### Two loop

```java
int N = A.length;
for (int i = 0; i < N; i += 1)
   for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j += 1)
      if (A[i] == A[j])
         return true;
return false;
```

* *C*=1+2+3+...+(*N*−3)+(*N*−2)+(*N*−1)=*N*(*N*−1)/2

* overall runtime is θ*(*N^2)

```java
public static void printParty(int N) {
   for (int i = 1; i <= N; i = i * 2) {
      for (int j = 0; j < i; j += 1) {
         System.out.println("hello");   
         int ZUG = 1 + 1;
      }
   }
}
```

* *C*(*N*)=1+2+4+...+*N*=2*N*−1
* overall runtime is θ*(*N)

##### No magic shortcut

**1 + 2 + 3 + ... + *Q* = *Q*(*Q*+1)/2 = Θ(*Q*2) (Sum of First Natural Numbers)**

**1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + Q = 2Q - 1 =Θ(*Q*) (Sum of First Powers of 2)**

### Recursion

```java
public static int f3(int n) {
   if (n <= 1) 
      return 1;
   return f3(n-1) + f3(n-1);
}
```

* *C*(*N*)=1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^N-1

* *θ*(2^*N*).

### Binary Search

* *C*(*N*)=⌊*l**o**g*2(*N*)⌋+1

* Θ(log*N*)

### Merge Sort

* **arbitrary units of time** (AU)
* selection sort has Θ(*N*^2)
* Mergesort has worst case runtime Θ(*N*log*N*)
  * logN layer of the merge tree



### Takeaways

- There are no magic shortcuts for analyzing code runtime.
- In our course, it’s OK to do exact counting or intuitive analysis.
- Know how to sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N and 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + N.
- We won’t be writing mathematical proofs in this class.
- Many runtime problems you’ll do in this class resemble one of the five problems from today. See textbook, study guide, and discussion for more practice.
- This topic has one of the highest skill ceilings of all topics in the course. All the tools are here, but **practice** is your friend!
- Different solutions to the same problem, e.g. sorting, may have different runtimes (with big enough differences for the runtime to go from impractical to practical!).
- N^2*N*2 vs. N log N*N**l**o**g**N* is an enormous difference.
- Going from N log N*N**l**o**g**N* to N*N* is nice, but not a radical change.
