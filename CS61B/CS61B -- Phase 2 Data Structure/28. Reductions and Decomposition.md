### Topological Sort -- DAG

* **Topological Sort**: an ordering of a graph's vertices such that for every directed edge u -> v, u comes before v in the ordering.
* Topological sorts only apply to **directed, acyclic (no cycles) graphs** - or **DAG**s

* Topological sort is sometimes called a **linearization** of the graph.
  * Drawing in on line
* The topological sort for the above DAG has to start with either D or E and must end with F or C. 
  * For this reason, D and E are called *sources*, and F and C are called *sinks*.

#### Topological Sort Algorithm

- Perform a **DFS** traversal from every vertex in the graph, **not** clearing markings in between traversals.
- Record DFS **postorder** along the way.
- Topological ordering is the **reverse** of the postorder.

###### Why?

* Every vertex v gets added to the end of the postorder list only after considering **all descendants** of v.
* Using DFS -- *O*(*V*+*E*) 

###### Pseudocode

```java
topological(DAG):
    initialize marked array
    initialize postOrder list
    for all vertices in DAG:
        if vertex is not marked:
            dfs(vertex, marked, postOrder)
    return postOrder reversed

dfs(vertex, marked, postOrder):
    marked[vertex] = true
    for neighbor of vertex:
        dfs(neighbor, marked, postOrder)
    postOrder.add(vertex)
```

###### Or BFS

1. Calculate **in-degree** of all vertices.
2. Pick any vertex v*v* which has in-degree of 0.
3. Add v*v* to our topological sort list. Remove the vertex v*v* and all edges coming out of it. Decrement in-degrees of all neighbors of vertex *v* by 1.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all vertices are removed.



### Shortest Paths on DAGs

* Dijkstra's Negative Edge Weight Failure
* Idea: Visit vertices in **topological** order
  * On each visit, relax all outgoing edges
  * Each vertex is visited only **when all possible info about it has been used**



### Longest Path

##### In general

* Best known algorithm is exponential.

##### DAGs

1. Form a new copy of the graph, called G', with all edge weights **negated** (signs flipped).
2. Run DAG shortest paths on G' yielding result X
3. **Flip** the signs of all values in X.distTo. X.edgeTo is already correct.

### Reductions

* This process is known as **reduction**. 
* **Since DAG-SPT can be used to solve DAG-LPT, we say that "DAG-LPT reduces to DAG-SPT."**

#### Formal definition

* **If any subroutine for task Q can be used to solve P, we say P reduces to Q.**

###### Independent Set Problem

* An independent set is a set of vertices in which no two vertices are adjacent.

###### 3SAT Problem

* The 3SAT Problem: Given a boolean formula, does there exist a truth value for boolean variables that obeys a set of 3-variable disjunctive constraints?

**3SAT reduces to Independent Set**



### Reflection

* Abstract Lists reduce to arrays or linked lists
* Percolation reduces to Disjoint Sets
* Maze generation reduces to[]

##### Decomposition

* Breaking a complex task into smaller parts. 
* Using abstraction to make problem solving easier. 
* This is the heart of **computer science**.
