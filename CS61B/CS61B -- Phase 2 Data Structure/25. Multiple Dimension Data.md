#### Motivation --- Key

* HashTable --- Requires that keys can be hashed
* Search Tree --- Requires that keys can be compared

###### Quesions

* 2D Range Finding
* Nearest Neighbors in 2D map
* Not for Multi-dimensional keys



### Uniform Partitioning

* Partition space into uniform rectangular buckets (bins).

* still θ(N) runtime



### QuadTrees

* Every Node has **four** children:
  * Top left, a.k.a. northwest.
  * Top right, a.k.a. northeast.
  * Bottom left, a.k.a. southwest.
  * Bottom right, a.k.a. southeast. 

* Each node owns 4 subspace

#### 3D data

* Oct-tree -- 8 subtree



### k-d trees

##### Higher dimensional space

* Not in space but more properties to considerate

#### k-d tree for 2-d

* root node partitions entire space into left and right (by x).
  * All depth 1 nodes partition subspace into up and down (by y).
  * All depth 2 nodes partition subspace into left and right (by x).
  * And so on

* When you are running operations on a K-D Tree or quadtree, you should be thinking about the tree structure (**1st** image) and not the 2-D space (2nd picture) because only the tree holds information about the levels.
* No matter how high the dimensions get, a K-D tree will always be a **binary** tree, since each level is partitioned into "greater" and "less than".



#### Nearest Pseudocode

```java
nearest(Node n, Point goal, Node best):
	If n is null, return best
	If n.distance(goal) < best.distance(goal), best = n
	If goal < n (according to n’s comparator):
		goodSide = n.”left”Child
		badSide = n.”right”Child
	else:
		goodSide = n.”right”Child
		badSide = n.”left”Child
	best = nearest(goodSide, goal, best)
	If bad side could still have something useful
		best = nearest(badSide, goal, best)
	return best

```



### Summary

###### More set operations

* Range finding (rectangular subspace)
* Nearest

###### Most common approach

* **Uniform Partitioning**
  * Partition space into uniform chunks.
* **Quadtree**
  * Generalized 2D BST where each node “owns” 4 subspaces.
* **K-d tree**
  * Generalized k-d BST where each node “owns” 2 subspaces.
  * **Dimension** of ownership **cycles** with each level of depth in tree.
