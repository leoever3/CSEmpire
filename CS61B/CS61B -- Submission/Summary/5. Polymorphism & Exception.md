#### Subtype Polymorphism

* Subtype Polymorphism allows us to use a subtype of a class or interface **in its place** so we can write functions that can operate on a wide array of objects so long as they have a certain **attribute in common**.

```java
class Dog extends Animal{}
Animal d = new Dog();
class Cat extends Animal{}
Animal c = new Cat();
d.compareTo(c);
```

#### Exceptions

* **Exceptions** are used to stop the code and inform the person running it when something occurs that is not allowed.
  * NullPointerException
  * IndexOutOfBoundsException
* `throw new RuntimeException("Because I said so.")`
* Try - catch

#### Iterators & Iterable

* Iterators are objects that can be iterated through in Java (enhanced loop)

```java
public interface Iterator<T> {
		boolean hasNext();
		T next();
}
```

* Iterables are objects that can **produce an iterator**.

```java
public interface Iterable<T> {
  	Iterator<T> iterator();
}
```
