### Quicksort Flavors

#### Quicksort L3S

* Pivot selection: Always use **leftmost**.
* Partition algorithm: Make an array copy then do **three** scans for red, white, and blue items (white scan trivially finishes in one compare).
* **Shuffle** before starting (to avoid worst case).

#### Tony Hoare’s In-place Partitioning Scheme

Tony originally proposed a scheme where two pointers walk towards each other.

* Left pointer **loves small items.**
* Right pointer **loves large items**.
* Big idea: Walk towards each other, swapping anything they don’t like.
  * End result is that things on left are “small” and things on the right are “large”.

Using this partitioning scheme yields a **very fast** Quicksort.

#### Quicksort PickTH

* Median Identification
* Pick to find the exact median
* **Terrible runtime**



### Quicksort vs. Mergesort

### Quick Selection

* Computing the exact median would be great for picking an item to partition around. Gives us a “safe quick sort”.
* **Median identification algorithm**
  * **Partitioning**

* Worst case -- Θ(N^2) time.
* Average -- Θ(N) time.
  * N + N/2 + N/4 + … + 1 = Θ(N)



### Stability, adaptiveness, optimizatino

#### Stability

* A sort is said to be stable if order of equivalent items is preserved.

#### Optimizing Sorts

* Switch to insertion sort when a subproblem reaches size 15 or lower
* Make sort adaptive
* Exploit restrictions on set of keys
  * if number of keys is some constant
* For quick sort -- make the algorithm introspective

#### Array.sort

In Java, Arrays.sort(someArray) uses:

* **Mergesort** (specifically the TimSort variant) if someArray consists of Objects.
  * We want the stable sorting because objects can have many properties, e.g. section and name, so equivalent items CAN be differentiated.
* **Quicksort** if someArray consists of primitives.
