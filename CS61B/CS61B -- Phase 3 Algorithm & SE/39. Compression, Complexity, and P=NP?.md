* The goal of a compression algorithm is to find **short sequences of bits** that generate desired longer sequences of bits.

###### MysteryX: HugPlant.java

* The piece of code to generate the .bmp file is much shorter than the bitstream



### Optimal Compression and Kolmogorov Complexity

#### Kolmogorov Complexity

Give a target bitstream B , what is the shortest bitstream C<sub>B</sub> that outputs B.

* The Java-Kolmogorov complexity **K<sub>J</sub>(B)** is the length of the shortest Java program (in bytes) that generates B.

**Fact #1**: Kolmogorov Complexity is effectively **independent** of language.

**Fact #2**: It is **impossible** to write a program that even calculates the Kolmogorov Complexity of any bitstream.



#### Space/Time Bounded Compression

* We can create a space/time bounded compression algorithm.

* Question:
  * efficient space/time bounded compression algorithm

### P = NP?

Two important classes of **yes/no** problems:

* **P**: Efficiently solvable problems.
* **NP**: Problems with solutions that are efficiently verifiable.*

**Any decision problem for which a yes answer can be efficiently verified** can be transformed into a 3SAT problem.

#### Does P = NP?

* Tons of NP problems that all **reduce** to each other.

**If P=NP, then mathematical proof can be automated!** 

* P=NP means checking a proof is roughly as easy as creating the proof.
* First observed informally by Kurt GÃ¶del himself.



### Short vs. Comprehensible
