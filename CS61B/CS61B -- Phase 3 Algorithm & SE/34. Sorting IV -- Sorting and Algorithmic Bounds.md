* **In the end of lec34, we can find the implementations of all the sorts**



### Sorting

* Useful for putting things in oder.
* Sorting improves duplicate finding from a naive N2 to N log N.
* Sorting improves 3SUM from a naive N3 to N2.



### Math problems out of nowhere

* N! ∈ Ω((N/2)<sup>N/2</sup>)
* log(N!) ∈ Ω(N log N).
* N log N ∈ Ω(log(N!))

Informally:  **N log N = log(N!)**



### Theoretical Bounds on Sorting

We know so far: Runtime for sorting

* R(N) ∈ O(N log N) -- merge sort
* R(N) ∈ Ω(N) -- At least go through all the elements



#### The game of Puppy, Cat, Dog

* N = 3, we need 6 leaves.
  * 3!=6
* N = 4, we need 24 leaves.
  * 4! = 24
  * We need a binary tree with 24 leaves.
    * lg(24) = 4.58, so 5 is the minimum.

1. So for the questions need to ask in “puppy, cat, dog” problem for N items:
   * Ω(log(N!))

2. We can use Sorting the boxes to solve “puppy, cat, dog” problem.
3. In other words, puppy, cat, dog **reduces** to sorting.
4. Thus, any lower bound on difficulty of puppy, cat, dog must ALSO apply to sorting.
5. R(N) ∈ Ω(log(N!)) = Ω(N log N).

### Punchline

* Our best sorts have achieved absolute asymptotic optimality.
* Mathematically impossible to sort using fewer comparisons.

* Randomized quicksort is only probabilistically optimal.
