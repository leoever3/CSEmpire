### Automatic Conversions

##### Autoboxing and Unboxing

primitive types & reference types

"wrapper classes"

![wrapper classes](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/assets/wrapper_classes.png)

Java will automatically "box" and "unbox" values between a primitive type and its corresponding reference type. 

##### widening

Java will also automatically widen a primitive if needed.

int to double



### Immutability

An immutable data type is a data type whose instances cannot change in any observable way after instantiation.

#### String

`String` objects in Java are immutable.

This means that when `String` objects are concatenated, neither of the original Strings are modified -- instead, a totally new `String` object is returned.

#### final

The `final` keyword is a keyword for variables that prevents the variable from being changed after its first assignment.

```java
public class Date {
    public final int month;
    public final int day;
    public final int year;
    private boolean contrived = true;
    public Date(int m, int d, int y) {
        month = m; day = d; year = y;
    }
}
```

Advantages of immutable data types:

- Prevents bugs and makes debugging easier because properties cannot change ever
- You can count on objects to have a certain behavior/trait

Disadvantages:

- You need to create a new object in order to change a property

#### Caveats:

```java
 public final ArrayDeque<String>() deque = new ArrayDeque<String>();
```

The `deque` variable is final and can never be reassigned, but the array deque object its pointing to can change! ArrayDeques are always mutable!



### Generics

#### ArrayMap

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

/***
 * An array-based implementation of Map61B.
 ***/
public class ArrayMap<K, V> implements Map61B<K, V> {

    private K[] keys;
    private V[] values;
    int size;

    public ArrayMap() {
        keys = (K[]) new Object[100];
        values = (V[]) new Object[100];
        size = 0;
    }

    /**
    * Returns the index of the key, if it exists. Otherwise returns -1.
    **/
    private int keyIndex(K key) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (keys[i].equals(key)) {
            return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public boolean containsKey(K key) {
        int index = keyIndex(key);
        return index > -1;
    }

    public void put(K key, V value) {
        int index = keyIndex(key);
        if (index == -1) {
            keys[size] = key;
            values[size] = value;
            size += 1;
        } else {
            values[index] = value;
        }
    }

    public V get(K key) {
        int index = keyIndex(key);
        return values[index];
    }

    public int size() {
        return size;
    }

    public List<K> keys() {
        List<K> keyList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            keyList.add(keys[i]);
        }
        return keyList;
    }
}
```

it's quite common to see generics in Java represented as a single **uppercase** letter

#### Puzzle

```java
$ javac ArrayMapTest.java
ArrayMapTest.java:11: error: reference to assertEquals is ambiguous
    assertEquals(expected, am.get(2));
    ^
    both method assertEquals(long, long) in Assert and method assertEquals(Object, Object) in Assert match
```

Cast `expected` to `Integer`

#### Generic methods

```java
public static <K,V> V get(Map61B<K,V> map, K key) {
    if map.containsKey(key) {
        return map.get(key);
    }
    return null;
}
```

```java
public static <K extends Comparable<K>, V> K maxKey(Map61B<K, V> map) {...}
```

The `K extends Comparable<K>` means keys must implement the comparable interface and can be compared to other K's. We need to include the `<K>` after `Comparable` because `Comparable` itself is a generic interface! Therefore, we must specify what kind of comparable we want. In this case, we want to compare K's with K's.

#### Type upper bounds

**When used with generics (like in generic method headers), `extends` imposes a constraint rather than grants new abilities**

#### Summary

- Autoboxing and auto-unboxing of primitive wrapper types.
- Promotion/widening between primitive types.
- Specification of generic types for methods (before return type).
- Type upper bounds in generic methods (e.g. `K extends Comparable<K>`).
