### Abstract Data Types (ADTS)

Deque is called an interface. Conceptually, we call deque an **Abstract data type**. Deque only comes with behaviors, not any concrete ways to exhibit those behaviors. In this way, it is abstract.

```java
public void addFirst(T item);
public void addLast(T item);
public boolean isEmpty();
public int size();
public void printDeque();
public T removeFirst();
public T removeLast();
public T get(int index);
```

### Java Libraries

- List: an ordered collection of items
  - A popular implementation is the [ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html)
- Set: an unordered collection of strictly unique items (no repeats)
  - A popular implementation is the [HashSet](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html)
- Map: a collection of key/value pairs. You access the value via the key.
  - A popular implementation is the [HashMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html)

### Exersices

```java
public static List<String> getWords(String inputFileName) {
    List<String> lst = new ArrayList<String>();
    In in = new In();
    while (!in.isEmpty()) {
        lst.add(in.readString()); //optionally, define a cleanString() method that cleans the string first.       
    }
    return lst;
}

public static int countUniqueWords(List<String> words) {
    Set<String> ss = new HashSet<>();
    for (String s : words) {
           ss.add(s);        
    }
    return ss.size();
}
```

```java
public static Map<String, Integer> collectWordCount(List<String> words) {
    Map<String, Integer> counts = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
    for (String t: target) {
        counts.put(s, 0);
    }
    for (String s: words) {
        if (counts.containsKey(s)) {
            counts.put(word, counts.get(s)+1);
        }
    }
    return counts;
}
```

### Java vs Python

Although verbose

We like Java in 61B! Here are some reasons why:

- Arguably, takes less time to write programs, due to features like:
  - Static types (provides type checking and helps guide programmer).
  - Bias towards interface inheritance leading to cleaner subtype polymorphism.
  - Access control modifiers make abstraction barriers more solid.
- More efficient code, due to features like:
  - Ability to have more control over engineering tradeoffs.
  - Single valued arrays lead to better performance.

- Basic data structures more closely resemble underlying hardware:
  - Would be weird to do ArrayDeque in Python, since there is no need for array resizing. However, in hardware (see 61C), variable length arrays donâ€™t exist.

### Abstract classes

#### Interfaces:

- All methods must be public.
- All variables must be public static final.
- Cannot be instantiated
- All methods are by default abstract unless specified to be `default`
- Can implement more than one interface per class

#### Abstract classes:

- Methods can be public or private
- Can have any types of variables
- Cannot be instantiated
- Methods are by default concrete unless specified to be `abstract`

**When in doubt, try to use interfaces** in order to reduce complexity.

### Packages

Package names give **give a canonical name for everything**.

 Canonical means a *unique representation* for a thing.
