### Hello World

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

- The program consists of a **class declaration**, which is declared using the keywords `public class`. In Java, <u>all code lives inside of classes</u>.
- The code that is run is inside of a method called `main`, which is declared as `public static void main(String[] args)`.
- We use **curly braces** `{` and `}` to denote the beginning and the end of a section of code.
- Statements must end with **semi-colons**.

### Variables and Loops

```java
public class HelloNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 0;
        while (x < 10) {
            System.out.print(x + " ");
            x = x + 1;
        }
    }
}
```

- Our variable x must be **declared** before it is used, *and it must be given a type!*
- Our loop definition is contained inside of curly braces, and the boolean expression that is tested is contained inside of **parentheses**.
- Our print statement is just `System.out.print` instead of `System.out.println`. This means we should not include a newline (a return).
- Our print statement adds a number to a space. This makes sure the numbers don't run into each other. 
- When we run it, our <u>prompt</u> ends up on the same line as the numbers.

### Static Typing

* One of the most important features of Java is that all variables and expressions have a so-called `static type`. 

* Java variables can contain values of that type, and only that type.

* Furthermore, the type of a variable can <u>never change</u>.

```java
public class HelloNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 0;
        while (x < 10) {
            System.out.print(x + " ");
            x = x + 1;
        }
        // x = "horse";
    }
}
```

- The compiler ensures that all types are compatible, making it easier for the programmer to debug their code.
- Since the code is guaranteed to be free of type errors, users of your compiled programs will never run into type errors.
- Every variable, parameter, and function has a declared type, making it easier for a programmer to understand and reason about code.

### Defining Functions in Java

```java
public class LargerDemo {
    public static int larger(int x, int y) {
        if (x > y) {
            return x;
        }
        return y;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(larger(8, 10));
    }
}
```

### Code Style, Comments, Javadoc

- Consistent style (spacing, variable naming, brace style, etc)
- Size (lines that are not too wide, source files that are not too long)
- Descriptive naming (variables, functions, classes), e.g. variables or functions with names like `year` or `getUserName` instead of `x` or `f`.
- Avoidance of repetitive code: You should almost never have two significant blocks of code that are nearly identical except for a few changes.
- Comments where appropriate. Line comments in Java use the `//` delimiter. Block (a.k.a. multi-line comments) comments use `/*` and `*/`.

#### Comments

```java
public class LargerDemo {
    /** Returns the larger of x and y. */           
    public static int larger(int x, int y) {
        if (x > y) {
            return x;
        }
        return y;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(larger(8, 10));
    }
}
```
