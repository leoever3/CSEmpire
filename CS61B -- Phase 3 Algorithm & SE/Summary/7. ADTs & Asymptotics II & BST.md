#### Abstract Data Types

* Abstract Data Types are data structures where we know **what** they do but not how.
* Usually represented as **interfaces** or **abstract classes** in java

* **List**, **Map**, **Set** are ADTs.
  * Can't directly instantiate ADTs
  * Make concrete **implementation** of these ADTs -- ArrayList, LinkedList



#### Binary Search Trees

* Binary Search Trees are data structures that allow us to **quickly access elements in sorted order**.
* Properties
  * Each node in a BST is a **root** of a smaller BST
  * Each node to the **left** of a root has a value **lesser** than that of the root
  * Each node to the **right** of a root has a value **greater** than that of the root

* BSTS can be **bushy** or **spindly**

###### Insertion

* Items in a BST are always inserted as **leaves**

###### Deletion

* Items in a BST are always deleted via a method called **Hibbard Deletion**
  * Node with no child
  * Node with one child
    * Replace the deleted node
  * Node with **two children**
    * Pick either the leftmost node in the right subtree or the rightmost node in the left subtree



#### Asymptotics

* Asymptotic analysis is only valid on very **large inputs**
* Do not believe in the Empiricism
* **Graphic** can be helpful

##### Recursion Asymptotic

1. Draw out the recuisive tree
   * A node for every function call
2. Determine **work per level**
3. Recognize **which sum** we are dealing with
4. Calculate the **height** of the tree
