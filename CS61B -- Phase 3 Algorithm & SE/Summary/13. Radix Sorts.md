* What if the items we are sorting are composed of "**digits**"?
* Could it potentially be faster to sort digit by digit?

### Radix Sorts

* A **radix** can be thought of as the alphabet or set of digits to choose form in some system.
  * The **radix size** of the English alphabat is 26.
  * The **radix size** of the Arabic numerals is 10.
* We use **counting sorts** to sorts each **digit**.

#### LSD Radix Sort

* Repeatedly sort the same list on each digit, going from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

###### Why works?

A = 1200, B = 1210

* Notice that A and B first differ at second least significant spot.
* After we sort all the numbers on that digit, A will be before B.
* Since every later pass is **stable**, A will remain before B.

#### MSD Radix Sort

* Sort fro the most significant digit to the least significant digit
* Recurse on each **subgroup** comparing next digit



How can we leverage the fact that each digit is in a **finite range 0 - 9**?

### Counting Sort

* Create an array of length 10, since there are 10 digits (Radix) -- Θ(R)
* Count number of items at each digit. -- Θ(N)
* Find starting points for each digit. -- Θ(R)
* Put in final array. -- Θ(N)

###### Runtime:

* **Θ(R + N)**

###### LSD Runtime

* **Θ(W(R + N))**
* W -- width of the numbers

###### MSD Runtime

* Best case: **Θ(R + N)**
* Worst case: **Θ(W(R + N)**
