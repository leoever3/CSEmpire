### Trees

Trees are sturctures that follow a few basic rules

1. If are N nodes, there are N-1 edges
2. There is exactly 1 path from every node to every other node
3. The above two rules means that trees are **fully connected** and contain **no cycles**

A **parent** node points towards its **child**.

The **root** of a tree is a node with no parent nodes.

A **leaf** of a tree is a node with no child nodes.



### Graphs

Graphs are more general.

* Graphs are sturcutres that contain **nodes** and **edges**.
* Graphs can be directed or undirected.
* Simple Graphs

#### Breadth First Search

* BFS means we visit the nodes of a tree **level by level**.
* It can also be though of as visiting nodes based of their distance to the root.
* BFS is usually done using **queue.**

#### Depth First Search

* DFS means we visit each **subtree** in some order recursively.
* DFS is usually done using a **stack**.
* 3 kind of traversal
  * Pre-order traversals
  * In-order traversals
  * Post-order traversals



### Heaps

Heaps are special trees that follow a few basic rules:

* Heaps are **complete**
  * The oly empty parts of a heap are in the **botom** row, to the **right**
* In a min-heap, each node must be smaller than all of its child nodes. The opposite is true for max-heaps.
