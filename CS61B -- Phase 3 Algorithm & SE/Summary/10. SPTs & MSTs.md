### Shortest Paths

| BFS                    | Dijkstra's             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Minimum edges**      | **Shortest Paths**     |
| No edge weight         | Edge weight            |
| Queue                  | Priority Queue -- Heap |
| **First In** First Out | **Smallest** First out |

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm

* When we popped off a node from the PQ, we claim that we find the shortest path from the source to the node.
* When every node popped off, we finish the while loop.

**Steps**

1. Pop node from the top of the queue - this is the current node.
2. Add/update distances of all of the children of the current node in the PQ.
3. Re-sort the priority queue (technically the PQ does this itself).
4. Finalize the distance to the current node from the root. (Every node is infinity at the beginning)
5. Repeat while the PQ is not empty.

#### A*

**Steps**

1. Pop node from the top of the queue - this is the current node.
2. Add/update distances of all of the children of the current node. This distance will be the sum of the distance up to that child node and our guess of how far away the goal node is (our **heuristic**).
3. Re-sort the priority queue.
4. Check **if we’ve hit the goal node** (if so we stop).
5. Repeat while the PQ is not empty.

#### Dijkstra's VS A*

| Dijkstra                                                   | A*                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Find the shortest path from source to **every other node** | Find the shortest path from source to **target** |
| Priority -- DistanceTo[]                                   | Priority -- DistanceTo[] + **Heuristic()**       |



### Minimum Spanning Trees

* set of edges that connect all the nodes in a graph whie being the smallest possible weight
  * **Minimum** -- smallest weight sum
  * **Spanning** -- all the nodes included
  * **Tree** -- no cycle
* MST may not be unique if there are multiple edges of the same weight

#### Prim's

* Prim’s builds MSTs by dividing the graph into two sets: the vertices incorporated into the MST, and those yet to be included. 
* It continually adds the lightest edge connecting those two sets, **sprawling** outward and claiming more and more nodes into the MST, until all nodes are included.

```java
Start with any node.
Add that node to the set of nodes in the MST.
While there are still nodes not in the MST:
		Add the lightest edge that leads to a node that is unvisited.
		Add the new node to the set of nodes in the MST.
```

#### Kruskal's Algorithm

* Kruskal’s builds MSTs by **sorting** all the edges, and then adding them to our MST in order–but at every step, if adding an edge would cause a cycle then it is not included. 
* Kruskal’s may **jump** around the graph. 

```java
While there are still nodes not in the MST:
		Add the lightest edge that doesn’t create a loop.
		Add the endpoints of that edge to the set of nodes in the MST.
```
