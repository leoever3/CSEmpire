#### Disjoint Sets

* Disjoint Sets also know as **Union Find**
  * Using in social network

```java
public interface DisjointSet {
	void connect (x, y); // Connects nodes x and y (you may also see union)
	boolean isConnected(x, y); // Returns true if x and y are connected
}
```

##### 4  Ways

###### QuickFind

* Uses an **array of integers** to track which set each element belongs to.
  * Connect takes much time

###### QuickUnion

* Stores the **parent** of each node rather than the set to which it belongs and merges sets by setting the parent of one root to the other.
  * Root --> -1

###### WeightedQuickUnion

* Does the same as QuickUnion except it decides which set is merged into which **by size**, reducing stringiness.
  * **Bushier** -- log(N)
  * **Roots save the size**

###### WQU with Path Compression 

* Sets the parent of each node to the **set’s root** whenever find() is called on it.

#### Asymptotics

* To **evaluate the performance** of programs using math
  * We **ignore** all constants and only care about the value with reference to the input(N).
* **Iteration** asymptotic
* **Recursion** asymptotic

###### Big O

* **Upper bound**
* **Worst case**
* If a function has big O in f(x), we say that it could grow at most as fast as f(x), but it could grow more slowly. 

###### Big Ω

* **Lower Bound**
* **Best Case**
* If a function has big Ω in f(x), we say that it could grow at least as slowly as f(x), but it could grow more quickly.

###### Big Θ

* **Tightest Bound**
* **Only exists** when the tightest upper bound and the tightest lower bound converge to the same value

##### 2 Sum

* 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + N = Θ(N^2)
* 1 + 2 + 4 + . . . + N = Θ(N)
