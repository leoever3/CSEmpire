### The Sorting Problem

* Useful task examples
  * Equivalent items are adjacent, allowing rapid **duplicate** finding.
  * Items are in invreasing order, allow **binary search**.
  * Can be converted into various balanced data structures. (**BST, KdTrees**)

* Definition
  * A **sort** is a permutation (re-arrangement) of a sequence of elements that puts the keys into non-decreasing order relative to a given ordering relation.

* Java note -- **compareTo**

```java
import java.util.Comparator;
 
public class LengthComparator implements Comparator<String> {
 	public int compare(String x, String b) {
      	return x.length() - b.length();
 	}
}
```

##### Inversion

* An **inversion** is a pair of elements that are out of order with respect to <.
* Sorting -- perform a sequence of operations that reduces inversions to 0.

##### Performance Definition

* Characterizations of the runtime efficiency are sometimes called the **time complexity** of an algorithm.
* Characterizations of the “**<u>extra</u>**" memory usage of an algorithm is sometimes called the **space complexity** of an algorithm.



### Selection Sort

1. Find smallest item.
2. Swap this item to the front and ‘fix’ it.
3. Repeat for unfixed items until all items are fixed.

* **Θ(N^2)** -- Using array



### Heapsort

* Instead of rescanning entire array looking for minimum, maintain a heap that getting the minimum is fast.
* **Max-oriented heap**

1. Insert all items into a max heap, and discard input array. Create output array.
2. Repeat N times:
   1. Delete largest item from the max heap.
   2. Put largest item at the end of the unused part of the output array.

* Time complexity -- **O(N log N)**
  * Getting items into the heap O(N log N) time.
  * Selecting *largest* item: Θ(1) time.
  * Removing *largest* item: O(log N) for each removal.
* Space complexitye is **Θ(N)** to build the additional copy of all of our data.

#### In-place Heapsort

* Treat input array as a heap to save space.

* Bottom-up heapify
  * Sink nodes in reverse level order.

* Time complexity -- O(N log N)
  * Bottom-up Heapification: O(N log N) time.
  * Same as naive Heapsort
* Space complexity -- **Θ(1)**



### Mergesort

* **lec15**

1. Split items into 2 roughly even pieces.
2. Mergesort each half (steps not shown, this is a **recursive** algorithm!)
3. Merge the two sorted halves to form the final result.

* Time complexity -- **Θ(N log N)**
  * (log N levels) * (Each level N jobs -- merge together) 
* Space complexity -- **Θ(N)**

```java
class Solution {
    // Top down merge sort
    public int[] sortArray(int[] nums) {
        mergeSort(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
        return nums;
    }
    
    private void mergeSort(int[] nums, int left, int right) {
        if (left >= right) {
            // not right - left <= 1 because right - left = 1 has two numbers
            return;
        }
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        mergeSort(nums, left, mid);
        mergeSort(nums, mid + 1, right);
        merge(nums, left, right);
    }
    
    private void merge(int[] nums, int left, int right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        int[] res = new int[right - left + 1];
        int lpointer = left;
        int rpointer = mid + 1;
        int pointer = 0;
        while (lpointer <= mid || rpointer <= right) {
            if (lpointer > mid || rpointer <= right && nums[lpointer] > nums[rpointer]) {
                res[pointer] = nums[rpointer];
                rpointer += 1;
            } else {
                res[pointer] = nums[lpointer];
                lpointer += 1; 
            }
            pointer += 1;
        }
        System.arraycopy(res, 0, nums, left, right - left + 1);
    }
}
```



### Insertion Sort

#### Naive Insertion Sort

1. Starting with an empty output sequence.
2. Add each item from input, inserting into output at right point.

#### In-place Insertion Sort

* Time complexity -- **Ω(N), O(N2)**

* On arrays with a small number of inversions, insertion sort is extremely fast.
