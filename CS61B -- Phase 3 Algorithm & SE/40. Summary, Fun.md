### A big Summary



#### Programming Languages

* Object based programming: Organize around objects.
* Object oriented programming:
  * Interface **Inheritance**.
    * Programmer only needs to know List APT, but not ArrayList resizing stuffs,
  * Implementation inheritance.
* Dynamic vs. static typing.
* Generic Programming, e.g. ArrayList<Integer>, etc.
* The model of memory as **boxes** containing bits.
* Bit representation of positive integers.
* Java.
* Some standard programming idioms/patterns: 
  * Objects as function containers (e.g. Comparators, [IntUnaryFunctions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15yANECs6fbXUhgOqc4Fu05eAWuZqAVb1wsMQ82mHaCY/edit#slide=id.g10a4194b67_0_295)).
  * Default method specification in interfaces ([Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QX6BW2ORZByt7iIoWBCDBSj4ctEubYLMlEylsW-smqU/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g78bbe4344_0638)). 
  * Iterators.

#### Data Structures in Java

Important data structure interfaces:

* java.util.Collection (and its subtypes).
  * With a special emphasis on Map (and its subtypes).
* Our own Collections (e.g. Map61B, Deque): Didn’t actually extend Collection.

Concrete implementations of these abstract implementations:

* Examples: ArrayDeque implements Deque.

#### Mathematical Analysis of Data Structure/Algorithm Performance

* Asymptotic analysis.
* O(·), Ω(·), Θ(·), and tilde notation.
* Worst case vs. average case vs. best case.
  * Exemplar of usefulness of average case: Quicksort
* Determining the runtime of code through inspection (often requires deep thought).
* Multiplicative resizing is much better than additive resizing (see midterm 2).
  * Multiplicative resizing results in Θ(1) add runtime for ArrayLists.
  * Additive resizing results in Θ(N) add runtime for ArrayLists.



#### Implementations for ADTs

#### Arrays vs. Linked Data Structures

Array-Based Data Structures:

* ArrayLists and ArrayDeque
* HashSets, HashMaps, MyHashMap: Arrays of ‘buckets’
* ArrayHeap (tree represented as an array)

Linked Data Structures

* Linked Lists
  * LinkedList, IntList, LinkedListDeque, SLList, DLList
* Trees: Hierarchical generalization of a linked list. Aim for bushiness.
  * TreeSet, TreeMap, BSTMap, Tries (trie links often stored as arrays)
* Graphs: Generalization of a tree (including many algorithms). 

**Tradeoffs** of arrays vs. linked data structures.

#### Fun

Compression:

* Huffman Coding, and selection of data structures for Huffman Coding.
* Other approaches: LZW and Run Length Encoding (extra slides).

Compression, Complexity, and P=NP:

* Optimal compression is impossible.
* Bounded space/time compression is possible if P=NP.
  * Allows you to find arbitrarily short programs that produce a given output in a given runtime.
  * Compression of a stream of bits might provide a useful model of that stream of bits (e.g. hugPlant.bmp -> hugPlant.java).
* If P = NP, we could also solve all kinds of other interesting problems.

#### The practice of Programming

* Java syntax and idioms.
* JUnit testing (and its more extreme form: Test-driven development).
* Mining the web for code.
* Debugging:
  * Identify the simplest case affected by the bug.
  * Hunt it down, giving it no place to hide.
  * With the right methodology, can find bugs even when finding bug through manual code inspection is impossible.
* Tactical vs. Strategic Programming.
  * Avoid information leakage. Build deep modules. Minimize dependencies. Minimize obscurity.
* Real tools: IntelliJ, git, command line
* Data structure selection (and API Design)
  * Drive the performance and implementation of your entire program.
