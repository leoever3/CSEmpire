### Radix Sort vs.Comparison Sorting

* Treating alphabet size as constant, LSD Sort has runtime **Θ(WN)**. 
* Merge Sort is between Θ(N log N) and **Θ(WN log N)**.

#### Cost Model

##### Therotical study

* We use number of characters examined.
  * charAt

* Suppose we have 100 strings of 1000 characters each.
  * For MSD Radix Sort
    * 100,000 charAt
  * For Mergesort
    * 660,000 charAt -- 1000Nlog2(N)

* **Therotically, Radix Sort is better than Mergesort.**

##### Empirical study

* An unexpected Factor -- **The Just-In-Time Compiler**

* As your code runs, the “interpreter” is watching everything that happens.If some segment of code is called many times, the interpreter actually studies and re-implements your code based on what it learned by watching WHILE ITS RUNNING (!!).
* The JIT was somehow able to **massively optimize the compareTo calls**. 

* **Bottom Line: Algorithms Can Be Hard to Compare**
* **JIT Compilers Are Always Evolving**



### Radix Sorting Integers

* In the very large N limit, it’s easy. Radix sort is simply faster!
* LSD radix sort an array of integers
  * Could convert into a String and treat as a base 10 number.
  * Could modify LSD radix sort to work natively on integers.



### Sorting Summary

* Three basic flavors: 
  * Comparison
  * Alphabet
  * Radix based
* Each can be useful in different circumstances, but the important part was the analysis and the deep thought!

##### Further Questions

* What if we use quicksort as a subroutine for MSD radix sort instead of counting sort?
* Implementing the comparable interface means an object can be stored in our compareTo-based data structures (e.g. TreeSet), or sorted with our comparison based sorts. Is there a single equivalent interface that would allow storage in a trie AND radix sorting? What would that interface look like?
* If an object has both digits AND is comparable, could we somehow use an LLRB to improve radix sort in some way?
