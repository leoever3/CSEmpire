* In a **lossless** algorithm we require that no information is lost.Text files often compressible by 70% or more.

##### Variable Length Codewords

* Use variable length codewords to represent symbols, with **shorter keywords** going with more common symbols.
* Morse code

#### Prefix Free Codes

* A prefix free code is a code where no codeword is a prefix of any other. 
* Prefix free codes can be uniquely decoded.

#### Shannon-Fano Coding 

* Count relative frequencies of all characters in a text.
* Split into ‘left’ and ‘right halves’ of roughly equal frequency
  * .Left half gets a leading zero. Right half gets a leading one.
  * Repeat.

#### Huffman Coding

Calculate relative frequencies.

* Assign each symbol to a node with weight = relative frequency.
* Take the two smallest nodes and merge them into a super node with weight equal to sum of weights.
* Repeat until everything is part of a tree.

 Resulting code is **optimal**.

#### Huffman Implementation

* Encoding: **Array / Map**
* Decoding: **Trie**
* For every possible input file, create a **unique code** just for that file. Send the code along with the compressed file.

##### Compression

1. Count frequencies
2. Build encoding array and decoding trie
3. Write decoding trie to output.huf
4. Write codeword for each symbol to output.huf

##### Decompression

1. Read in decoding trie
2. Use codeword bits to walk down the trie, outputting symbols every time you reach a leaf.

* General Principles Behind Compression. 
  * Huffman coding is all about representing common symbols with a small number of bits.

#### Universal Compression is Impossible

* It is impossible to create an algorithm that can compress any bitstream by 50%. 
* A second argument is that for an input bitstream of say, size 1000, only 1 in 2^499 is capable of being compressed by 50%, due to the pigeonhole principle.

### Compression Model 2: Self Extracting Bits

* Treat the algorithm and the compressed bitstream as a single sequence of bits

*  When fed to an interpreter, this self-extracting bit sequence generates a particular output sequence.
