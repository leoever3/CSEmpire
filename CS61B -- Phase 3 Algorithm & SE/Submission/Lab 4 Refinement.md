1. What was the most annoying bug you had and how did you fix it? Did you use the debugger? Did you fix it by adding special cases? Did you do any change-and-pray (where you make a tiny change and hope the AG approves)?
2. Did you end up cutting anything out to make your code simpler? If so, what?
3. Do you have any special cases in your code?
4. Do you have any private helper methods?
5. Does your code repeat itself anywhere? Would private helper methods have helped?
