* Complex **manual computation** of west, east, north, and south.
* Lots of variables that need to be manipulated exactly so.
* **Repetitive code** (steps += 1, setting equal to PLAYER and FLOOR).

##### Strategic programming

* move.equals(“a”) could simply set a variable equal to “WEST”, “EAST”, ...
* TETile getNeighbor(“WEST”) would return tile to the west.
* void move(player, world, “WEST”) could move player tile to the west.



###### Two primary sources of complexity

* **Dependencies**
  * When a piece of code cannot be read, understood, and modified independently.
* **Obscurity**
  * When important information is not obvious.



#### Bad programming 2

* Create an **interface** called InputDevice with a nextChar() method, and pass an InputDevice as an argument to the method.
  * Means you only need **one move method that handles any InputDevice**.



### Module Design

* **Hiding Complexity**
  * Programmer is only thinking about some of the complexity at once
  * **Helper methods**

* **Modular Design**
  * System would be broken down into modules
  * Minimize dependencies between modeules
* **Interface vs. Implementation**
  * The best modules are those whose **interfaces** are much **simpler** than their implementation.
    * Formal part: the list of method signatures
    * Informal part: rules for using the interface
  * The best **modules** are those that provide powerful functionality yet have simple interfaces. I use the term ***deep*** to describe such modules

* **Information hiding**
  * Information leakage
  * Temporal decomposition



### BYOW suggestions

* Build **classes** that provide functionality needed in many places in your code.
* Create “**deep** modules”, e.g. classes with simple interfaces that do complicated things.
* Avoid over-reliance on “temporal decomposition” where your decomposition is driven primarily by the order in which things occur.
  * It’s OK to use some temporal decomposition, but try to fix any information leakage that occurs!
* Be **strategic**, not tactical.
* Most importantly: **Hide information** from yourself when unneeded!
