### BFS VS DFS

* Correctness
  * Both work for all graphs
* Output Quality
  * BFS also guarantees to be shortest
* Time Efficiency
  * Similar
* Space Efficiency
  * DFS is worse for spindly graphs
  * BFS is worse for bushy graphs



### Dijkstra's Algorithm

* BFS returns path with shortest number of edges, but not the shortest distance (consider the weight of each edge)

* Solution will always be a path with no cycles
* Solution will always be a **tree**

#### Dijkstra's[/ˈdaɪkstrə/] Algorithm

* **Best first search**
* Relaxation: add edge to the SPT(shortest paths tree) only if that edge yields better distance

#### Pseucode

1. Create a priority queue.
2. Add s*s* to the priority queue with priority 00. Add all other vertices to the priority queue with priority \infty∞.
3. While the priority queue is not empty: pop a vertex out of the priority queue, and **relax** all of the edges going out from the vertex.

```java
PQ.add(source, 0)
For other vertices v, PQ.add(v, infinity)
While PQ is not empty:
	p = PQ.removeSmallest()
	Relax all edges from p
```

###### Relax

An edge p -> q with weight w:

If distTo[p] + w < distTo[q]:

​	distTo[q] = distTo[p] + w

​	edgeTo[q] = p

​	PQ.changePriority(q, distTo[q])

```java
def relax(edge p,q):
   if q is visited (i.e., q is not in PQ):
       return

   if distTo[p] + weight(edge) < distTo[q]:
       distTo[q] = distTo[p] + w
       edgeTo[q] = p
       PQ.changePriority(q, distTo[q])
```

* Key invariants:
  * edgeTo[v] is the best known predecessor of v.
  * distTo[v] is the best known total distance from source to v.
  * PQ contains all unvisited vertices in order of distTo.
* Important properties:
  * Always visits vertices **in order of total distance from source**.
  * Relaxation always fails on edges to **visited** (white) vertices.

##### Guaranteed Optimality

* No negative edges

### A*

* Problem with Dijkstra's in map
  * Dijkstra's will explore every place
* Idea:
  * Visit vertices in order of d(Denver, v) + h(v, goal), where h(v, goal) is an **estimate** of the distance from v to our goal NYC.
* Estimate
  * Estimate is an arbitrary **heuristic** (using experience to learn and improve)

### A* Heuristic

* Artificial intelligence topic



### Summary

##### Single Source Multiple Targets:

* Can represent shortest path from start to every vertex as a shortest paths tree with V-1 edges
* Can find the **SPT** using **Dijkstra's algorithms**

##### Single Source Single Target:

* **A*** is potentially much faster than Dijkstra's
  * Consistent heuristic guarantees correct solution
