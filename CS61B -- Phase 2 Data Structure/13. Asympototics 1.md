##### Writing Efficient Programs

Two flavors

* Programming cost
* Execution cost
  * Time complexity
  * Space complexity

Formal technique for comparing algorithmic efficiency

### Example: Duplicates in sorted array

##### Runtime characterization

* Technique1: Measure execution time

* Technique2: Count the number of times each operation is performed

```java
for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i += 1) {
  for (int j = i+1; j < A.length; j += 1) {
    if (A[i] == A[j]) {
       return true;
    }
  }
}
return false;
```

| **operation**       | **symbolic count**             | **count, N=10000** |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **i = 0**           | 1                              | 1                  |
| **j = i + 1**       | 1 to N*N*                      | 1 to 10000         |
| **less than (<)**   | 2 to (N^2+3N+2*N*2+3*N*+2)/2/2 | 2 to 50,015,001    |
| **increment (+=1)** | 0 to (N^2+N*N*2+*N*)/2/2       | 0 to 50,005,000    |
| **equals (==)**     | 1 to (N^2-N*N*2−*N*)/2/2       | 1 to 49,995,000    |
| **array accesses**  | 2 to N^2-N*N*2−*N*             | 2 to 99,990,000    |

##### Asymptotic Behavior

In most cases, we only care about what happens for very large N (asymptotic behavior). We want to consider what types of algorithms would best handle big amounts of data, such as in the examples listed below:

- Simulation of billions of interacting particles
- Social network with billions of users
- Encoding billions of bytes of video data

Algorithms that **scale** well (i.e. look like lines) have better asymptotic runtime behavior than algorithms that scale relatively poorly (i.e. looks like parabolas).

##### Optimization

* Simple and **mathematically rigorous**

* Simplication
  * Consider only the worst case
  * Oick a representative operation (aka: cost model)
  * Ignore low order terms
  * Ignore multiplicatice constants

###### Analysis of Nested For Loops: Exact Count

* Cost = 1 + 2 + 3 + … + (N-2) + (N-1)

###### Analysis of Nested For Loops: Geometric Argument

* We can see that the number of equals can be given by the area of a right triangle, which has a side length of N - 1

### Big-Theta

* **Order of Growth**
