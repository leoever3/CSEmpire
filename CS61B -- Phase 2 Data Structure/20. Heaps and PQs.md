### New ADT: Priority Queue

#### The priority queue interface

* Binary Search Trees
  * Log N time to efficient search
* We cared more about quickly finding the smallest or largest element instead of quickly searching.

```java
/** (Min) Priority Queue: Allowing tracking and removal of 
  * the smallest item in a priority queue. */
public interface MinPQ<Item> {
    /** Adds the item to the priority queue. */
    public void add(Item x);
    /** Returns the smallest item in the priority queue. */
    public Item getSmallest();
    /** Removes the smallest item from the priority queue. */
    public Item removeSmallest();
    /** Returns the size of the priority queue. */
    public int size();
}
```

* For the ordered array, it need to resize -- O(N)



#### What we got

* Priority Queue is an Abstract Data Type that optimizes for handling minimum or maximum elements.
* There can be space/memory benefits.
* A binary search tree among the other structures is the most efficient



### Heaps

We will define our binary min-heap as being **complete** and obeying **min-heap** property:

- Min-heap: Every node is **less than** or **equal** to both of its children
- Complete: Missing items only at the **bottom** level (if any), all nodes are as far **left** as possible.

#### Heap operations

* getSmallest: Return the root of the heap (This is guaranteed to be the minimum by our *min-heap* property

- add: Add to the end of heap temporarily. Swim up the hierarchy to the proper place.

  - Swimming involves swapping nodes if child < parent

- removeSmallest

  : Swap the last item in the heap into the root. Sink down the hierarchy to the proper place.

  - Sinking involves swapping nodes if parent > child. Swap with the smallest child to preserve *min-heap* property.



### Tree representation

#### 1A

```java
public class Tree1A<Key> {
  Key k;
  Tree1A left;
  Tree1A middle;
  Tree1A right;
  ...
}
```

#### 1B

```java
public class Tree1B<Key> {
  Key k;
  Tree1B[] children;
  ...
}
```

#### 1C

```java
public class Tree1C<Key> {
  Key k;
  Tree1C favoredChild;
  Tree1C sibling;
  ...
}
```

#### 2

* Just like Disjoint Sets, we store the keys array as well as a parents array.

```java
public class Tree2<Key> {
  Key[] keys;
  int[] parents;
  ...
}
```

#### 3

* Because the tree is complete, the parents array has a sort of redundant pattern where elements are just doubled.

```java
public class TreeC<Key> {
  Key[] keys;
  ...
}
```

### Swim

```java
public void swim(int k) {
    if (keys[parent(k)] ≻ keys[k]) {
       swap(k, parent(k));
       swim(parent(k));              
    }
}

public int parent(int k) {
  return (k - 1) / 2;
}
```

### Implementation

* We leave one empty spot at the beginning of the array to simplify computation.
* `leftChild(k)`= k * 2=*k*∗2
* `rightChild(k)`= k * 2 + 1=*k*∗2+1
* `parent(k)` = k / 2=*k*/2

#### Summary

- Heap operations are **amortized** analysis, since the array will have to resize (not a big deal)
- BST's can have constant time `getSmallest` if pointer is stored to smallest element
- Array-based heaps take around 1/3rd the memory it takes to represent a heap using approach 1A (direct pointers to children)
