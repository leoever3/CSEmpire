#### CS vs. Math

* CS bring life to math by a machine

### Complexity

* Complexity -- the greatest enemy
* Tools like **IntelliJ**, **Unit test**, the intellij **debugger**, the **visualizer** all make it easier to deal with complexity.

#### Dealing with complexity

* Making code **simpler** and more obvious
  * Sentinel nodes
* **Encapsulation** into **modules**
  * In a modular design, creators of one “module” can use other modules without knowing how they work.

#### Defination of Complexity

“Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify the system.”



### Symptoms and causes of Complexity

#### Symptoms

* **Change amplification**
  * A simple change requires modification in many places
* **Cognitive load**
  * How much you need to know in order to make a change
  * Don't like ++ or --
* **Unknown unknowns**

#### Obvious system

In an obvious system, to make a change a developer can:

* Quickly understand how existing code works.
* Come up with a proposed change without doing too much thinking.
* Have a high confidence that the change should actually work, despite not reading much code.

###### Complexity comes slowly

#### Causes of Complexity

* Dependencies
* Obscurity
  * Good variable naming habit



### Strategic vs Tactical Programming

##### Tactical Programming

* Main focus is to get something working
  * A new feature or bug fix

##### Strategic Programming

* **Long term structure** of the system
* For each new class/task
  * Rather than implementing the first idea, try coming up with **a few different idea**.
  * Found something that feels **clean**.
