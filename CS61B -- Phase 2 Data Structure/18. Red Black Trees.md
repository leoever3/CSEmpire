### Tree Rotation

```
rotateLeft(G): Let x be the right child of G. Make G the new left child of x.

rotateRight(G): Let x be the left child of G. Make G the new right child of x.
```

```java
private Node rotateRight(Node h) {
    // assert (h != null) && isRed(h.left);
    Node x = h.left;
    h.left = x.right;
    x.right = h;
    return x;
}

// make a right-leaning link lean to the left
private Node rotateLeft(Node h) {
    // assert (h != null) && isRed(h.right);
    Node x = h.right;
    h.right = x.left;
    x.left = h;
    return x;
}
```



### Red-black Trees

* 2-3 trees remain balanced but hard to implement
* **Left-leaning** tree
  * When we create a "glue" node, we choose arbitrarily to make the left element a child of the right one.
  * We show that a link is a glue link by making it **red**.
* Left-Leaning Red-Black trees have a **1-1 correspondence** with 2-3 trees. Every 2-3 tree has a unique LLRB red-black tree associated with it.
* As for 2-3-4 trees, they maintain correspondence with standard Red-Black trees.

### Properties of LLRB's

- 1-1 correspondence with 2-3 trees.
- **No node has 2 red links.**
- **There are no red right-links.**
- **Every path from root to leaf has same number of black links** (because 2-3 trees have same number of links to every leaf).
- **Height is no more than 2x height of corresponding 2-3 tree.**

### Inserting into LLRB -- Rotation

- When inserting: Use a **red** link.
- If there is aright leaning “3-node”, we have a Left Leaning Violation
  - Rotate **left** the appropriate node to fix.
- If there are two consecutive left links, we have an incorrect 4 Node Violation!
  - Rotate **right** the appropriate node to fix.
- If there are any nodes with two red children, we have a temporary 4 Node.
  - **Color flip** the node to emulate the split operation.

```java
private Node put(Node h, Key key, Value val) {
    if (h == null) { return new Node(key, val, RED); }

    int cmp = key.compareTo(h.key);
    if (cmp < 0)      { h.left  = put(h.left,  key, val); }
    else if (cmp > 0) { h.right = put(h.right, key, val); }
    else              { h.val   = val;                    }

    if (isRed(h.right) && !isRed(h.left))      { h = rotateLeft(h);  }
    if (isRed(h.left)  &&  isRed(h.left.left)) { h = rotateRight(h); }
    if (isRed(h.left)  &&  isRed(h.right))     { flipColors(h);      } 

    return h;
}
```



### Summary for BST, B-trees and Red Black trees

- **Binary search trees** are simple, but they are subject to **imbalance** which leads to crappy runtime.
- **2-3 Trees (B Trees)** are balanced, but painful to implement and relatively slow.
- LLRBs insertion is simple to implement (but deletion is hard).
  - Works by maintaining mathematical bijection with a 2-3 trees.
- Java’s [TreeMap](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk11/blob/999dbd4192d0f819cb5224f26e9e7fa75ca6f289/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/TreeMap.java) is a red-black tree (but not left leaning).
- LLRBs maintain correspondence with 2-3 tree, Standard Red-Black trees maintain correspondence with 2-3-4 trees.
- Allows glue links on either side (see [Red-Black Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red–black_tree)).
- More complex implementation, but significantly faster.
