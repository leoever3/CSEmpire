#### B-trees

* B-trees also refered to as **2-3 trees**.
* B-trees are trees that serve a similar function to binary tree while ensuring a **bushy structure**.
  * Not adding new leaves, instead **overstuff** the current leaf nodes
  * **Push** the middle element if the node is too big
* **Perfectly balanced but hard to implement**

* Each node can habe up to **2 items** and **3 children**.
* All leaves are the **same distance** from the root which makes getting take **Θ(log N)** time.

* There are variations known as **2-3-4 trees**.

###### Adding

* When adding to a B-tree, you first start by **adding to a leaf node**, and then **pushing** the excess items up the tree until it follows the rules.



#### Left Leaning Red Black Trees

* LLRBS are a representation of B-trees that we use beacause it is easy to work with in code.
  * Bijection with B-trees
  * Makeing the code **simple**
* Each multi-node in a 2-3 tree is represented using a **red** connection on the **left** side.

* **3 Balancing Operations**
  * RotateLeft(A)
    * Right leaning
  * RotateRight(A)
    * Overstuffed
  * ColorFlip(a)
    * Overstuffed
* Check
  * Still BST
  * All leaves shold be the same height
  * **Red links do not add the height**



#### Hashing

* **Hashing functions** are functions that represent an object using an integer.
* We use the **hash code** to figure out which bucket of our hashes the item should go in.
  * **Module %**

* In each bucket, we deal with having lots of item by **chaining** the items and using .equals to find what we are looking for.
  * .equal -> same hash code
  * same hash code !-> .equal

##### Steps

* Store object in Set -> **Array**
  * It is constant time accessing a specific order --> Θ(log*N*)

1. Compute **hashcode** --> object.hashcode()
   * Default hashcode --> memory
2. Go to the correct **bucket**

​		Array have fixed length ---> hashcode % M = bucket.    M --> how many buckets we have

2.5 Each bucket can only store 1 item

​		Create a **linkedList** of the indices

3. **Iterate** thrrough linkeLlist --> .equal()
   1. Equal key --> override
   2. Else --> insert at the end of linkedList
4. **Resize** the Array by threshold N/M

* HashSet VS HashMAp -- **both no duplicate**
