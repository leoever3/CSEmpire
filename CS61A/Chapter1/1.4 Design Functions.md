### 4 Designing Functions

**Good functions**

* Each function should have exactly **one** job
* Don't repeat yourself
  * **DRY**
* Functions should be defined generally

#### 4.1 Documentation

##### Docstring

* Documentation describing the function
  * Triple quoted
  * The first line describes the job of th function
  * The following lines can describe atguments and clarify the behavior

```python
>>> def pressure(v, t, n):
        """Compute the pressure in pascals of an ideal gas.

        Applies the ideal gas law: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law

        v -- volume of gas, in cubic meters
        t -- absolute temperature in degrees kelvin
        n -- particles of gas
        """
        k = 1.38e-23  # Boltzmann's constant
        return n * k * t / v
```

* Call help with the name of a function to see its docstring

```python
>>> help(function name)
```

#### 4.2 Default Argument Value

* In Python, we can provide default values for the arguments of a function
* When calling the function, arguments with default values are **optional**
