### 2 Elements of Programming

**Computer language mechanisms**

* primitive expressions and statements
  * simpliest building blocks
* means of **combination**
  * compound elements are built from simpler ones
* means of **abstraction**
  * compound elements are be named and manipulated

**Elements**

* **Functions**
* **Data**

#### 2.1 Expressions

* primitive expressions
  * Numbers conbined with mathematical operators

```python
>>> 42
42

>>> -1 - -1
2
```

#### 2.2 Call Expressions

* **Mapping**

* The **operator** specifies a function
* The function max is called with **arguments** 7.5 and 9.5 and **returns** a value of 9.5

* Advantages of **function notation**
  * Functions may take an arbitrary number of arguments
  * Nested expressions
  * Mathematical notation has a great variety of forms and it is hard to type

#### 2.3 Importing library Functinos

* Python Library
  * Organizes the functions and other quantities into **modules**

```python
>>> from operator import add, sub, mul
>>> add(14, 28)
```

* Python3 Library Docs
  * http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/index.html

#### 2.4 Names and the Environment

* Using **names** to refer to computational objects

* The name **binds to** the value.

```python
>>> radius = 10
>>> f = max
```

##### Assignment

* The **=** symbol is called the assignment operator.
* Assignment is the simplest means of **abstraction**
  * It allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound operations
  * In this way, complex programs are constructed by building step by step, computational objects of increasing **complexity**.

* Names can also be bound to functions.

* Names are often called **variables**.
* We can even bind **built-in names** to new values.

```python
>>> max = 5
```

* **<u>Assign multiple values to multiple names</u>**

```python
>>> area,circumference = pi, 2 * pi
>>> x, y = y, x
```

* <u>**Changing the value of one name does not affect other names**</u>
  * Changing pi does not affect area

#### 2.5 Evaluating Nested Expressions

* The evaluation provedure is **recursive**. It includes the need to invoke the rule itself.

* **Expression tree**
  * **Top down**
  * The objects at each point in a tree are called **nodes**

#### 2.6 Non-Pure Print Function

* **Pun functions**
  * Functions have some input and **return some output**.
  * Pure functions have no effects beyond returning a value
  * Always return the same value when called twice
* **Non-pure functions**
  * In addition to returning a value, a non-pure functions can generate **side effects** which make some changes to the state of the interpreter or computer.
  * Print

```python
>>> print(print(1), print(2))
1
2
None None
```

* Advantages of Pure Functions
  * More reliably in compound call expressions
  * Simple to test
  * Essentiral for writing concurrent programs
