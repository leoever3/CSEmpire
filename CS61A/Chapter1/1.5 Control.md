### 5 Control

#### 5.1 Statements

* Expressions --- evaluate
* Statements --- execute
  * Assignment
  * def
  * return
  * print

#### 5.2 Compound Statement

```Python
<header>:
    <statement>
    <statement>
    ...
<separating header>:
    <statement>
    <statement>
    ...
...
```

* Colon
* Header contorls its suite
* To execute a sequence of statements, execute the first statement. If that statement does not **redirect control**, then proceed to execute the rest of the sequence of statements, if any remain.

* When indenting a suite, all lines must be indented the same **amout** and in the same **way**(spaces/tab).

#### 5.3 Define Function 2: Local Assignment

* Local frame -- local environment
* **return** -- redirects control
* Modular programming
  * Pure functions interact only via the values they take and return

#### 5.4 Conditional Statements

```python
if <expression>:
    <suite>
elif <expression>:
    <suite>
else:
    <suite>
```

##### Boolean contexts

* False values
  * 0
  * None
  * False
* True values
  * all other numbers
* **Comparision operations** (\>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=) return boolean values

##### Boolean operators

* and
* or
* not

**Evaluation procedure**

* Short-circuiting

**convention**

* Fuctions that perform comparisons and return boolean values typically begin with **is** and not followed by an uderscore
  * isfinite

#### 5.5 Iteration

* **Iterative control structures** are mechanism for executing the same statements many times

* Evaluating everything on the right of = before updating any bindings on the left

```python
while <expression>:
    <suite>
```

* The suite should always change some binding in each pass.
* A while statement that does not teminate is called an infinite loop.
  * Ctrl-c to force python to stop looping

#### 5.6 Testing

* Testing a functino is the act of verifying that the function's behavior matches expectations.

##### Assertions

* Programmers use **assert** statements to verify expectations

* An `assert` statement has an expression in a **boolean** context, followed by a **quoted line of text** that will be displayed if the expression evaluates to a false value.

```python
>>> def fib_test():
        assert fib(2) == 1, 'The 2nd Fibonacci number should be 1'
        assert fib(3) == 1, 'The 3rd Fibonacci number should be 1'
        assert fib(50) == 7778742049, 'Error at the 50th Fibonacci number'
```

##### Doctests

```python
>>> def sum_naturals(n):
        """Return the sum of the first n natural numbers.

        >>> sum_naturals(10)
        55
        >>> sum_naturals(100)
        5050
        """
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k, k + 1
        return total
```

```python
>>> from doctest import testmod
>>> testmod()
TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
```

```python
>>> from doctest import run_docstring_examples
>>> run_docstring_examples(sum_naturals, globals(), True)
Finding tests in NoName

Trying:

```

* All doctests in a file can be run by starting Python with the dockets command line option:

```python
python3 -m doctest<oython_siyrce_file>
```

* unit test
