### 6 Higher-Order Functions

Function -- abstraction -- High level

Powerful programming language -- build **abstractions** by assigning names to common patterns and then to work in terms of the **names** directly

###### Higher-Order functions

* Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return functions as values



#### 6.1 Functions as Arguments

```python
def summation(n, term):
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + term(k), k + 1
    return total

def cube(x):
    return x*x*x
  
def pi_term(x):
    return 8 / ((4*x-3) * (4*x-1))
summation(3, cube)
summation(1e6, pi_term)
```

#### 6.2 Functions as General Methods

* A **parameter** is the variable which is part of the method's **signature** (method declaration). 
* An **argument** is an **expression used when calling the** method

```python
def improve(update, close, guess=1):
    while not close(guess):
        guess = update(guess)
    return guess

def golden_update(guess):
    return 1/guess + 1

def square_close_to_successor(guess):
    return approx_eq(guess * guess, guess + 1)

def approx_eq(x, y, tolerance=1e-3):
    return abs(x - y) < tolerance

phi = improve(golden_update, square_close_to_successor)
```

###### Big ideas

* Naming and functions allow us to **abstract** away a vast amount of complexity. 
* it is only by virtue of the fact that we have an extremely general evaluation procedure for the Python language that small components can be **composed** into complex processes.



#### 6.3 Define Functions 3: Nested Definitions

###### Nested function

* Deal with the problem that global frame becomes cluttered with names of small functions
* Two argument --> one argument

###### Lexical scope 

* 词法作用域

* Sharing names among nested definitions
* **The inner functions have access to the names in the environment where they are defined**

###### **<u>Environment model</u>**

1. Each user-defined function has a parent environment: **the environment in which is was <u>defined</u>**
2. When a user-defined function is **<u>called</u>**, **its local frame extends its parent environment**

```Python
def average(x, y):
    return (x + y)/2

def improve(update, close, guess=1):
    while not close(guess):
        guess = update(guess)
    return guess

def approx_eq(x, y, tolerance=1e-3):
    return abs(x - y) < tolerance

def sqrt(a):
    def sqrt_update(x):
        return average(x, a/x)
    def sqrt_close(x):
        return approx_eq(x * x, a)
    return improve(sqrt_update, sqrt_close)

result = sqrt(256)
```

* Within the body of `improve`, we must apply our `update` function (bound to `sqrt_update`) to the initial guess `x` of 1. 
* This final application creates an environment for `sqrt_update` that begins with a local frame containing only `x`, 
* but with the parent frame `sqrt` still containing a binding for `a`.
* The most critical part of this evaluation procedure is the transfer of the parent for `sqrt_update` to the frame created by calling `sqrt_update`. This frame is also annotated with `[parent=f1]`.

###### Extended Environment

* An environment can consist of arbitrarily long chain of frames
* Always concludes with the global frame
* A **local function** can access the environment of the enclosing functino
* Local functions are oftern called closures

#### 6.4 Functions as Returned Values

* The locally defined functinos maintain their parent environment when they are returned

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

def successor(x):
    return x + 1

def compose1(f, g):
    def h(x):
        return f(g(x))
    return h

def f(x):
    """Never called."""
    return -x

square_successor = compose1(square, successor)
result = square_successor(12)
```

* The 1 in compose1 is meant to signify that the composed functinos all take a single argument

#### 6.5 Example: Newton's Method

```python
def newton_update(f, df):
    def update(x):
        return x - f(x) / df(x)
    return update
    
def find_zero(f, df):
    def near_zero(x):
        return approx_eq(f(x), 0)
    return improve(newton_update(f, df), near_zero)

def square_root_newton(a):
    def f(x):
        return x * x - a
    def df(x):
        return 2 * x
    return find_zero(f, df)
>>> square_root_newton(64)
8.0
```

#### 6.6 Currying

* Use higher-oder functions to convert a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take a single argument

```python
>>> def map_to_range(start, end, f):
        while start < end:
            print(f(start))
            start = start + 1
>>> map_to_range(0, 10, curried_pow(2))

>>> def curry2(f):
        """Return a curried version of the given two-argument function."""
        def g(x):
            def h(y):
                return f(x, y)
            return h
        return g
>>> curry2(pow)(2)(5)
```



#### 6.7 Lambda Expressions

* **unnamed** functions
* A lambda expression evaluates to **functions** by specifying two things: the parameters and a return expression

**lambda** <parameters>: <**return** expression>

```python
>>> def compose1(f, g):
        return lambda x: f(g(x))
```

```python
     lambda            x            :          f(g(x))
"A function that    takes x    and returns     f(g(x))"
```

* It has no intrinsic name
* Named with the greek letter λ

```python
def compose1(f, g):
    return lambda x: f(g(x))

f = compose1(lambda x: x * x,
             lambda y: y + 1)
result = f(12)
```

##### Lambda VS def

|                           | lambda                                                       | def                                                          |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type                      | *Expression* that evaluates to a **value**                   | *Statement* that alters the **environment**                  |
| Result of execution       | Creates an anonymous lambda function with **no intrinsic** name. | Creates a function with an intrinsic name and binds it to that name in the current environment. |
| Effect on the environment | Evaluating a `lambda` expression does *not* create or modify any variables. | Executing a `def` statement both creates a new function object *and* binds it to a name in the current environment. |
| Usage                     | A `lambda` expression can be used anywhere that expects an expression, such as in an assignment statement or as the operator or operand to a call expression. | After executing a `def` statement, the created function is bound to a name. You should use this name to refer to the function anywhere that expects an expression. |
| Example                   | `# A lambda expression by itself does not alter the environment lambda x: x * x                   # We can assign lambda functions to a name # with an assignment statement square = lambda x: x * x square(3) # Lambda expressions can be used as an operator # or operand negate = lambda f, x: -f(x) negate(lambda x: x * x, 3)` | `def square(x):    return x * x # A function created by a def statement # can be referred to by its intrinsic name square(3)` |

#### 6.8 Abstractions and First-Class Functions

* Programming languages impose restrictinos on the ways in which computational elements can be manipulated
* Elements with the **fewest** restrictinos are said to have **first-clsss status**

* First-class elements
  * They may be bound to names
  * They may be passed as arguments to functinos
  * They may be returned as the results of functions
  * They may be included in data structures

#### 6.9 Function Decorators

* 装潢

```python
>>> def trace(fn):
        def wrapped(x):
            print('-> ', fn, '(', x, ')')
            return fn(x)
        return wrapped

>>> @trace
    def triple(x):
        return 3 * x

>>> triple(12)
->  <function triple at 0x102a39848> ( 12 )
36
```

* Annotation
  *  @trace

* trace
  * Return a function that precedes a call to its argument with a print statement that outputs the argument
