# Lambda Expressions

A lambda expression evaluates to a function, called a lambda function. For example, `lambda y: x + y` is a lambda expression, and can be read as "a function that takes in one parameter `y` and returns `x + y`."

A lambda expression by itself evaluates to a function but does not bind it to a name. Also note that the return expression of this function is not evaluated until the lambda is called. This is similar to how defining a new function using a def statement does not execute the functionâ€™s body until it is later called.

```
>>> what = lambda x : x + 5
>>> what
<function <lambda> at 0xf3f490>
```

Unlike `def` statements, lambda expressions can be used as an operator or an operand to a call expression. This is because they are simply one-line expressions that evaluate to functions. In the example below, `(lambda y: y + 5)` is the operator and `4` is the operand.

```
>>> (lambda y: y + 5)(4)
9
>>> (lambda f, x: f(x))(lambda y: y + 1, 10)
11
```

# Higher Order Functions

A **higher order function** (HOF) is a function that manipulates other functions by taking in functions as arguments, returning a function, or both. For example, the function `compose` below takes in two functions as arguments and returns a function that is the composition of the two arguments.

```python
def composer(func1, func2):
    """Return a function f, such that f(x) = func1(func2(x))."""
    def f(x):
        return func1(func2(x))
    return f
```

HOFs are powerful abstraction tools that allow us to express certain general patterns as named concepts in our programs.

## Currying

One important application of HOFs is converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take a single argument. This is known as **currying**. For example, the function below converts the `pow` function into its curried form:

```python
>>> def curried_pow(x):
        def h(y):
            return pow(x, y)
        return h

>>> curried_pow(2)(3)
8
```

# Self Reference

Self-reference refers to a particular design of HOF, where a function eventually returns itself. In particular, a self-referencing function will not return a function **call**, but rather the function object itself. As an example, take a look at the `print_all` function:

```python
def print_all(x):
    print(x)
    return print_all
```

Self-referencing functions will often employ helper functions that reference the outer function, such as the example below, `print_sums`.

```python
def print_sums(n):
    print(n)
    def next_sum(k):
        return print_sums(n + k)
    return next_sum
```

A call to `print_sums` returns `next_sum`. A call to `next_sum` will return the result of calling `print_sums` which will, in turn, return another function `next_sum`. This type of pattern is common in self-referencing functions.





```python
def match_k(k):
    """ Return a function that checks if digits k apart match

    >>> match_k(2)(1010)
    True
    >>> match_k(2)(2010)
    False
    >>> match_k(1)(1010)
    False
    >>> match_k(1)(1)
    True
    >>> match_k(1)(2111111111111111)
    False
    >>> match_k(3)(123123)
    True
    >>> match_k(2)(123123)
    False
    """
    def helper(x):
        while x // (10 ** k):
            if x % 10 != (x // (10 ** k)) % 10:
                return False
            x = x // 10
        return True
    return helper
```
