### 3.5 Interpreters for Languages with Abstraction

Abstraction: define new operators, give names to values, or express general methods of computation



#### 3.5.1 Structure

##### Parser

* Produces an expression that is interpreted by an evaluator
* Support quotation or dotted lists

##### Evaluator

* primitives
* Call expressions
* special forms

##### Procedure application

* `PrimitiveProcedure` is implemented in Python
* `LambdaProcedure` is implemented in Scheme

##### Eval/apply recursion

The functions that implment the evaluation process, `scheme_eval` and `scheme_apply` are mutally recursive.



#### 3.5.2 Environment

##### `Frame` class

* Each `Frame` instance represents an environment in which symbols are bound to values.

* A frame has a dictionary of `bindings` as well as a `parent` frame that is `None` for the global frame
  * Bindings are not accessed directly but instead through two `Frame` methods: `lookup` and `define`.



Define a function has several steps:

1. Check the format of the expression to ensure that it is a well-formed Scheme list with at least two elements following the keyword `define`.
2. Analyze the first element, in this case a `Pair`, to find the function name `factorial` and formal parameter list `(n)`.
3. Create a `LambdaProcedure` with the supplied formal parameters, body, and parent environment.
4. Bind the symbol `factorial` to this function, in the first frame of the current environment. In this case, the environment consists only of the global frame.



#### 3.5.3 Data as Programs

```scheme
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

 Evaluating expressions that are constructed as a part of execution is a common and powerful feature in dynamic programming languages. In few languages is this practice as common as in Scheme, but the ability to construct and evaluate expressions during the course of execution of a program can prove to be a valuable tool for any programmer.
