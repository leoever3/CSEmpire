### 3.1 Introduction

###### So far

Chapter 1: Functions

Chapter 2: Data

Connection between functions and data:

- functions can be manipulated as data using higher-order functions
- data can be endowed with behavior using message passing and an object system

###### This chapter: Program itself

> A python program is just a collection of text.
>
> Only through the process of interpretation do we perform any meaningful computation based on that context.
>
> A programming language can define an interpreter, a program that carries out Python's evaluation and execution procedures.



#### 3.1.1 Programming languages

A new language: [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language))

Many interpreters have an elegant common structure: two mutually recursive functions. The first evaluates expressions in environments; the second applies functions to arguments.
