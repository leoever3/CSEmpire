### 1.6. Higher-Order Functions

###### So far:

Functions are a method of abstraction that describe compound operations independent of the particular values of their arguments.

###### Now:

The ability to build abstractions by <u>assigning names to common patterns and then to work in terms of the names directly.</u>

To express certain general patterns as named concepts, we will need to construct functions that can <u>accept other functions as arguments or return functions as values</u>. 

<u>Functions that manipulate functions are called **higher-order functions.**</u>



#### 1.6.1 Functions as Arguments

We need three functions:

1. computes the sum of natural numbers up to `n`
2. computes the sum of the cubes of natural numbers up to `n`
3. `pi_sum`, computes the sum of terms in the series

```python
def summation(n, term):
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + term(k), k + 1
    return total

def cube(x):
    return x*x*x
  
def pi_term(x):
    return 8 / ((4*x-3) * (4*x-1))
summation(3, cube)
summation(1e6, pi_term)
```



#### 1.6.2 Functions as General Methods

> Abstraction:
>
> User-defined functions as a mechanism for abstracting patterns of numerical operations so as to make them **independent of the particular numbers involved.**
>
> With higher-order functions, we begin to see a more powerful kind of abstraction: some functions express general methods of computation, **independent of the particular functions they call.**



* A **parameter** is the variable which is part of the method's **signature** (method declaration). 
* An **argument** is an **expression used when calling the** method

```python
# This improve function is a general expression of repetitive refinement. It doesn't specify what problem is being solved: those details are left to the update and close functions passed in as arguments.
def improve(update, close, guess=1):
    while not close(guess):
        guess = update(guess)
    return guess

def golden_update(guess):
    return 1/guess + 1

def square_close_to_successor(guess):
    return approx_eq(guess * guess, guess + 1)

def approx_eq(x, y, tolerance=1e-3):
    return abs(x - y) < tolerance

phi = improve(golden_update, square_close_to_successor)
```

> ###### Big ideas in Computer Science
>
> * Naming and functions allow us to **abstract** away a vast amount of complexity. 
> * it is only by virtue of the fact that we have an extremely general evaluation procedure for the Python language that small components can be **composed** into complex processes.

#### 1.6.3 Define Functions III: Nested Definitions

###### Some negative consequences so far:

1. The global frame becomes cluttered with names of small functions
2. We are constrained by particular function signatures

```Python
## We want to define a two-arguments update function to calculate sqrt and use improve function, but it is incompatible
def average(x, y):
    return (x + y)/2

def sqrt_update(x, a):
    return average(x, a/x)
  
  
def improve(update, close, guess=1):
    while not close(guess):
        guess = update(guess)
    return guess

def approx_eq(x, y, tolerance=1e-3):
    return abs(x - y) < tolerance

## We can define a nested function
def sqrt(a):
    def sqrt_update(x):
        return average(x, a/x)
    def sqrt_close(x):
        return approx_eq(x * x, a)
    return improve(sqrt_update, sqrt_close)

result = sqrt(256)
```

Like local assignment, local `def` statements only affect the current local frame. These functions are only in scope while `sqrt` is being evaluated.

###### <u>Lexical scope</u> 

* Lexical scope: Sharing names among nested definitions
* The inner functions have access to the names in the environment ==**<u>where they are defined</u>**== but not where they are called.



> ###### Parent
>
> The parent of a function value is the first frame of the environment in which that function was defined.
>
> Functions without parent annotations were defined in the global environment.
>
> When a user-defined function is called, the frame created has <u>the same parent as that function.</u>



Analyze the parent

> 1. Within the body of `improve`, we must apply our `update` function (bound to `sqrt_update`) to the initial guess `x` of 1. 
>
> 2. This final application creates an environment for `sqrt_update` that begins with a local frame containing only `x`, but with the parent frame `sqrt` still containing a binding for `a`.
>
> 3. The most critical part of this evaluation procedure is the transfer of the parent for `sqrt_update` to the frame created by calling `sqrt_update`. This frame is also annotated with `[parent=f1]`.



###### **<u>Environment model</u>**

1. Each user-defined function has a parent environment: **the environment in which is was <u>defined</u>**
2. When a user-defined function is **<u>called</u>**, **its local frame extends its parent environment**



###### Extended Environment

* An environment can consist of arbitrarily long chain of frames
  *  By calling functions that were defined within other functions, via nested `def` statements, we can create longer chains. 

* Always concludes with the global frame
* A local function can access the environment of the **enclosing function**
* Local functions are oftern called closures



#### 1.6.4 Functions as Returned Values

An important feature of lexically scoped programming languages is that locally defined functions <u>maintain their parent environment when they are returned</u>

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

def successor(x):
    return x + 1

# function composition: h(x) = f(g(x))
def compose1(f, g): ## 1 in compose1 means that it take 1 argument
    def h(x):
        return f(g(x))
    return h

def f(x):
    """Never called."""
    return -x

square_successor = compose1(square, successor)
result = square_successor(12)
```



#### 1.6.5 Example: Newton's Method

> Newton's method is a classic iterative approach to finding the arguments of a mathematical function that yield a return value of 0. These values are called the *zeros* of the function. 
>
> Finding a zero of a function is often equivalent to solving some other problem of interest, such as computing a square root.
>
> Newton's method is an iterative improvement algorithm: it improves a guess of the zero for any function that is *differentiable*, which means that it can be approximated by a straight line at any point. Newton's method follows these linear approximations to find function zeros.
>
> Imagine a line through the point $(x,f(x))$ that has the same slope as the curve for function $f(x)$ at that point. Such a line is called the *tangent*, and its slope is called the *derivative* of $f$ at $x$.
>
> This line's slope is the ratio of the change in function value to the change in function argument. Hence, translating $x$ by $f(x)$ divided by the slope will give the argument value at which this tangent line touches 0.

```python

    while not close(guess):
        guess = update(guess)
    return guess

def approx_eq(x, y, tolerance=1e-3):
    return abs(x - y) < tolerance

def find_zero(f, df):
    """Find the intersection of the function with the x-axis"""
    def near_zero(x):
        return approx_eq(f(x), 0)
    return improve(newton_update(f, df), near_zero)

def newton_update(f, df):
    def update(x):
        return x - f(x) / df(x)
    return update

def square_root_newton(a):
    def f(x):
        return x * x - a
    def df(x):
        return 2 * x
    return find_zero(f, df)

def cube_root_newton(a):
    return find_zero(lambda x: x*x*x - a, lambda x: 3*x*x)

### Improvement
def power(x, n):
    """Return x * x * x * ... * x for x repeated n times."""
    product, k = 1, 0
    while k < n:
        product, k = product * x, k + 1
    return product

def nth_root_of_a(n, a):
  	"""More general version to compute the nth root."""
    def f(x):
        return power(x, n) - a
    def df(x):
        return n * power(x, n-1)
    return find_zero(f, df)

res = nth_root_of_a(6, 64)
```



#### 1.6.6 Currying

Use higher-oder functions to convert a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take a single argument. More specifically, given a function `f(x, y)`, we can define a function `g` such that `g(x)(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`.

Here, `g` is a higher-order function that takes in a single argument `x` and returns another function that takes in a single argument `y`. This transformation is called **currying**.

Currying is useful <u>when we require a function that takes in only a single argument</u>

```python
def curry2(f):
    """Return a curried version of the given two-argument function."""
    def g(x):
        def h(y):
            return f(x, y)
        return h
    return g

def uncurry2(g):
    """Return a two-argument version of the given curried function."""
    def f(x, y):
        return g(x)(y)
    return f

pow_curried = curry2(pow)
curry2(pow)(2)(5)
uncurry2(pow_curried)(2, 5)
```



#### 1.6.7 Lambda Expressions

> In Python, we can create function values on the fly using `lambda` expressions, which evaluate to **unnamed functions.** 
>
> A lambda expression evaluates to a function that has a **single return expression as its body**. <u>Assignment and control statements are not allowed.</u>
>
> The result of a lambda expression is called a **lambda function**
>
> It has no intrinsic name, named with the greek letter $Î»$



A lambda expression evaluates to **functions** by specifying two things: the parameters and a return expression

**lambda** <parameters>: <**return** expression>

```python
     lambda            x            :          f(g(x))
"A function that    takes x    and returns     f(g(x))"
```

```python
def compose1(f, g):
    return lambda x: f(g(x))

f = compose1(lambda x: x * x,
             lambda y: y + 1)
result = f(12)
```

##### Lambda VS def

|                           | lambda                                                       | def                                                          |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type                      | *Expression* that evaluates to a **value**                   | *Statement* that alters the **environment**                  |
| Result of execution       | Creates an anonymous lambda function with **no intrinsic** name. | Creates a function with an intrinsic name and binds it to that name in the current environment. |
| Effect on the environment | Evaluating a `lambda` expression does *not* create or modify any variables. | Executing a `def` statement both creates a new function object *and* binds it to a name in the current environment. |
| Usage                     | A `lambda` expression can be used anywhere that expects an expression, such as in an assignment statement or as the operator or operand to a call expression. | After executing a `def` statement, the created function is bound to a name. You should use this name to refer to the function anywhere that expects an expression. |
| Example                   | `# A lambda expression by itself does not alter the environment lambda x: x * x                   # We can assign lambda functions to a name # with an assignment statement square = lambda x: x * x square(3) # Lambda expressions can be used as an operator # or operand negate = lambda f, x: -f(x) negate(lambda x: x * x, 3)` | `def square(x):    return x * x # A function created by a def statement # can be referred to by its intrinsic name square(3)` |

`lambda` expressions are notoriously illegible:

In general, Python style prefers explicit `def` statements to lambda expressions, but allows them in cases where a simple function is needed as an argument or return value.



#### 1.6.8 Abstractions and First-Class Functions

Programming languages impose restrictions on the ways in which computational elements can be manipulated. Elements with the **fewest** restrictions are said to have **first-clsss status**

* First-class elements
  * They may be bound to names
  * They may be passed as arguments to functinos
  * They may be returned as the results of functions
  * They may be included in data structures

<u>Python awards functions full first-class status</u>, and the resulting gain in expressive power is enormous.



#### 1.6.9 Function Decorators

```python
>>> def trace(fn):
        def wrapped(x):
            print('-> ', fn, '(', x, ')')
            return fn(x)
        return wrapped

>>> @trace
    def triple(x):
        return 3 * x

>>> triple(12)
->  <function triple at 0x102a39848> ( 12 )
36
```

* Annotation
  *  @trace

* trace
  * Return a function that precedes a call to its argument with a print statement that outputs the argument
