### 1.2. Elements of Programming

Programs must be written for people to **read**, and only incidentally for machines to **execute**.

###### Computer language mechanisms

* **primitive expressions and statements**
  * simpliest building blocks
* means of **combination**
  * compound elements are built from simpler ones
* means of **abstraction**
  * compound elements are be named and manipulated

###### Elements

* **Functions**: functions describe the rules for manipulating the data
* **Data**:  data is stuff that we want to manipulate



#### 1.2.1 Expressions

primitive expressions

1. A number is a primitive expression
2. Expressions representing numbers may be combined with mathematical operators to form a **compound expression**

```python
>>> 42
42

>>> -1 - -1
0
```



#### 1.2.2 Call Expressions

* The most important kind of compound expression is a *call expression*, which applies a function to some arguments.
* **Mapping**

* The **operator** specifies a function: The function max is called with **arguments** 7.5 and 9.5 and **returns** a value of 9.5

<u>Advantages</u> of function notation

* Functions may take an **arbitrary number of arguments**
* Function notation extends in a straightforward way to **nested** expressions
  * `>>> max(min(1, -2), min(pow(3, 5), -4))`
* Mathematical notation has a great variety of forms and it is hard to type



#### 1.2.3 Importing library Functinos

* Python defines a very large number of functions and organizes the functions and other quantities into **modules**

###### Python Library

```python
>>> from operator import add, sub, mul
>>> add(14, 28)
```

#### 1.2.4 Names and the Environment

A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides for <u>using names to refer to computational objects</u>.

##### Bind name to value

##### `name = value`

Names are also bound via `import` statements.

```python
>>> radius = 10
>>> radius
10

>>> from math import pi
>>> pi * 71 / 223
1.0002380197528042
```

###### Assignment operator : `=`

* Assignment is the simplest means of **abstraction**
  * It allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound operations
  * In this way, complex programs are constructed by building step by step, computational objects of increasing **complexity**.




##### Bind name to functions.

* The name `max` is bound to the max function

```java
>>> max
<built-in function max>
```

* Use assignment statements to give new names to existing functions.

```python
>>> f = max
>>> f
<built-in function max>
>>> f(2, 3, 4)
4
```



###### Variables

Names are often called **variables** because they can be bound to different values in the course of executing a program

* We can even bind **built-in names** to new values.

```python
>>> max = 5
>>> max
5
```



**<u>Evaluation order</u>**

When executing an assignment statement, Python <u>evaluates the expression to the right of `=` before changing the binding to the name on the left</u>. Therefore, one can refer to a name in right-side expression, even if it is the name to be bound by the assignment statement.

```python
>>> x = 2
>>> x = x + 1
>>> x
3
```

**<u>Assign multiple values to multiple names</u>**

```python
>>> area,circumference = pi, 2 * pi

>>> x, y = 3, 4.5
>>> y, x = x, y
>>> x
4.5
>>> y
3
```

<u>**Changing the value of one name does not affect other names**</u>

```python
>>> x = 5
>>> x
5
>>> y = 2 * x
>>> y
10
>>> x = 6
>>> x
6
>>> y
10
```



#### 1.2.5 Evaluating Nested Expressions

To evaluate a call expression, Python will do the following:

1. Evaluate the operator and operand subexpressions, then
2. Apply the function that is the value of the operator subexpression to the arguments that are the values of the operand subexpressions.



The evaluation provedure is **recursive**; that is, It includes the need to invoke the rule itself.

###### Expression tree

* **Top down**
* The objects at each point in a tree are called **nodes**

###### Role of environment

* Environments provide the context in which evaluation takes place, which plays an important role in our understanding of program execution

```bash
>>> add(z, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'z' is not defined
```



#### 1.2.6 Non-Pure Print Function

* **Pun functions**
  * Functions have some input and **return some output**.
  * Pure functions have no effects beyond returning a value
  * Always return the same value when called twice
* **Non-pure functions**
  * In addition to returning a value, a non-pure functions can generate **side effects** which make some changes to the state of the interpreter or computer.
  * Print

```python
>>> print(print(1), print(2))
1
2
None None
```

<u>Advantages</u> of Pure Functions

* More reliably in compound call expressions
* Simple to test
* Essentiral for writing concurrent programs
