### 1.4. Designing Functions

###### So far:

The formal properties of functions

###### Now:

What makes a good function.



> **Good functions**
>
> - Each function should have exactly one job. 
>   - That job should be identifiable with a short name and characterizable in a single line of text.
>   -  Functions that perform multiple jobs in sequence should be divided into multiple functions.
> - Don't repeat yourself
>   * **DRY**
> - Functions should be defined generally



#### 1.4.1 Documentation

A function definition will often include documentation describing the function, called a *docstring*,

> Docstring: Documentation describing the function
>
> * Triple quoted
> * The first line describes the job of the function in one line
> * The following lines can describe atguments and clarify the behavior

```python
>>> def pressure(v, t, n):
        """Compute the pressure in pascals of an ideal gas.

        Applies the ideal gas law: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law

        v -- volume of gas, in cubic meters
        t -- absolute temperature in degrees kelvin
        n -- particles of gas
        """
        k = 1.38e-23  # Boltzmann's constant
        return n * k * t / v
```

* Call help with the name of a function to see its docstring, (type `q` to quit Python help).

```python
>>> help(function name)

>>> q ## quit
```

#### 1.4.2 Default Argument Value

* In Python, we can provide default values for the arguments of a function
  * `>>> def pressure(v, t, n=6.022e23):`
* When calling the function, arguments with default values are **optional**
