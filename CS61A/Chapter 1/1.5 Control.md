### 1.5. Control

#### 1.5.1 Statements

Statements govern the relationship among different expressions in a program and what happens to their results.

###### Expressions vs. Statements

* Expressions --- evaluate
* Statements --- **execute**
  * Assignment `=`
  * `def`
  * `return`
  * `print`



#### 1.5.2 Compound Statement

> A simple statement is a single line that doesn't end in a colon.
>
> A compound statement is so called because it is composed of other statements (simple and compound)
>
> * Compound statements typically span multiple lines and start with a one-line **header** ending in a **colon**, which identifies the type of statement. 
> * Together, a header and an indented suite of statements is called a **clause**. A compound statement consists of one or more clauses:

```Python
<header>:
    <statement>
    <statement>
    ...
<separating header>:
    <statement>
    <statement>
    ...
...
```

> We say that the header controls its suite. 
>
> * For example, in the case of `def` statements, we saw that the return expression is **not** evaluated **immediately**, but instead stored for later use when the defined function is eventually called.
> * To execute a sequence of statements, execute the first statement. If that statement does **not redirect** control, then proceed to execute the rest of the sequence of statements, if any remain.

**Practical Guidance**: When indenting a suite, all lines must be indented the same **amout** and in the same **way**(spaces/tab).



#### 1.5.3 Define Function II: Local Assignment

* Local frame -- local environment
* **return** -- redirects control
* Modular programming
  * Pure functions interact only via the values they take and return



#### 1.5.4 Conditional Statements

```python
if <expression>:
    <suite>
elif <expression>:
    <suite>
else:
    <suite>
```



```python
>>> def absloteabsolute_value(x):
...     """Compute abs(x)."""
...     if x > 0:
...         return x
...     elif x == 0:
...         return 0
...     else:
...        return -x
... 
>>> absloteabsolute_value(-5)
5
```

###### Boolean contexts

* False values
  * `0`, `None`, `False`
* True values
  * all other numbers
* **Comparision operations** (\>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=) return boolean values

###### Boolean operators

* `and`, `or`, `not`

```python
>>> True and False
False
>>> True or False
True
```

###### Short-circuiting

the truth value of a logical expression can sometimes be determined without evaluating all of its subexpressions,

###### **convention**

* Fuctions that perform comparisons and return boolean values typically begin with **is** and not followed by an uderscore
  * `isfinite()`, `isinstance()`



#### 1.5.5 Iteration

* **Iterative control structures** are mechanism for executing the same statements **many times**

* Evaluating everything on the right of = before updating any bindings on the left

```python
while <expression>:
    <suite>
```

* The suite should always change some binding in each pass.
* A while statement that does not teminate is called an **infinite loop**.
  * ` control-C` to force python to stop looping

```python
def fib(n):
    """" Compute the nth fibonacci number, n >= 2. """
    prev, curr = 0, 1
    k = 2
    while k < n:
        prev, curr = curr, prev + curr
        k = k + 1
    return curr
print(fib(8))

# Remember that commas seperate multiple names and values in an assignment statement.
# All of the expressions to the right of = are evaluated before any rebinding takes place.
```



#### 1.5.6 Testing

> Testing a function is the act of **verifying** that the function's behavior matches expectations.
>
> A *test* is a mechanism for systematically performing this verification. 
>
> Tests typically take the form of another function that contains one or more sample calls to the function being tested. The returned value is then verified against an expected result. 
>
> Unlike most functions, which are meant to be general, tests involve selecting and validating calls with specific argument values. 
>
> Tests also serve as documentation: they demonstrate how to call a function and what argument values are appropriate.

###### Assertions

* Programmers use **assert** statements to verify expectations

* An `assert` statement has an expression in a **boolean** context, followed by a **quoted line of text** that will be displayed if the expression evaluates to a false value.

```python
>>> def fib_test():
        assert fib(2) == 1, 'The 2nd Fibonacci number should be 1'
        assert fib(3) == 1, 'The 3rd Fibonacci number should be 1'
        assert fib(50) == 7778742049, 'Error at the 50th Fibonacci number'
```

###### Doctests

> Python provides a convenient method for placing simple tests directly in the docstring of a function. 
>
> The first line of a docstring should contain a one-line description of the function, followed by a blank line.
>
> A detailed description of arguments and behavior may follow. 
>
> In addition, the docstring may include a sample interactive session that calls the function:

```python
>>> def sum_naturals(n):
        """Return the sum of the first n natural numbers.

        >>> sum_naturals(10)
        55
        >>> sum_naturals(100)
        5050
        """
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k, k + 1
        return total
```

```python
>>> from doctest import testmod
>>> testmod()
TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
```

```python
>>> from doctest import run_docstring_examples
>>> run_docstring_examples(sum_naturals, globals(), True)
Finding tests in NoName
Trying:
    sum_naturals(10)
Expecting:
    55
ok
Trying:
    sum_naturals(100)
Expecting:
    5050
ok
```

* All doctests in a file can be run by starting Python with the dockets command line option:

```python
python3 -m doctest<oython_siyrce_file>
```

* unit test
