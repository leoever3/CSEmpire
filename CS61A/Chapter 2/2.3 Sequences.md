### 2.3 Sequences

> A sequence is an ordered collection of values.
>
> Sequences are a collection of several different types of data representation that share common behavior
>
> * **length**. A sequence has a finite length. An empty sequence has length 0.
> * **Element selection**. A sequence has an element corresponding to any none-negative integer index less that its length starting from 0.



#### 2.3.1 Lists

> A `list` value is a sequence that can have arbitrary length.

```python
>>> digits = [1, 8, 2, 8]
>>> len(digits)
4
>>> digits[3]
8
```

###### Concatenation and repetition

```python
>>> [2, 7] + digits * 2
[2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 8]
```

###### Nested lists

```python
>>> pairs = [[10, 20], [30, 40]]
>>> pairs[1]
[30, 40]
>>> pairs[1][0]
30
```



#### 2.3.2 Sequence Iteration -- `for`

```python
def count(s, value):
    """Count the number of times value occurs in 
    sequence s.
    """
    total = 0
    for element in s:       
        if element == value:
            total += 1
    return total
```

```pseudocode
for <name> in <expression>:
    <suite>
```

> A `for` statement is executed by the following procedure:
>
> 1. Evaluate the header<expression>, which must yield an iterable value.
> 2. For each element value in that iterable value, in order:
>    1. Bind<name> to that value in the current frame.
>    2. Execute the <suite>

Lists are type of sequence, and sequences are **iterable** values.

<name> will be bound to the last element of the sequence after the `for` statement is executed.

###### Sequence unpacking

```python
pairs = [[1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3], [4, 4]]
same_count = 0
for x, y in pairs:
    if x == y:
        same_count += 1
```



#### Ranges

> A `range` is another built-in type of sequence in Python, which represents a range of integers.

```python
>>> range(1, 10)  # Includes 1, but not 10
range(1, 10)
>>> range(4)  # 0, 1, 2, 3
```

Calling the `list` constructor on a range evaluates to a list with the same elements as the range

```python
>>> list(range(5, 8))
[5, 6, 7]
```



Ranges commonly appear as the expression in a `for` header to specify the number of times that the suite should be executed.

 A common convention is to use a single <u>underscore</u> character for the name in the `for` header if the name is unused in the suite:

```python
def cheer():
    for _ in range(3):
        print("Go Bears")
```



#### 2.3.3 Sequence Processing

Modular components that have sequences as both inputs and outputs can be mixed and matched to perform **data processing.**

###### List Comprehensions

> General form:
>
> ```pseudocode
> [<map expression> for <name> in <sequence expression> if <filter expression>]
> ```



```python
>>> odds = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
>>> [x+1 for x in odds]
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

With $square\ brackets[\ ]$, the resulting values are collected into a list.

```python
>>> [x for x in odds if 25 % x == 0]
[1, 5]
```



###### Aggregation

> To aggregate all values in a sequence into a single value.
>
> * `sum`
> * `min`
> * `max`

```python
>>> def divisors(n):
        return [1] + [x for x in range(2, n) if n % x == 0]
>>> divisors(4)
[1, 2]
 
# compute perfect number: A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its divisors.

>>> [n for n in range(1, 1000) if sum(divisors(n)) == n]
[6, 28, 496]

# finding the minimum perimeter of a rectanger given its area
>>> def width(area, height):
        assert area % height == 0
        return area // height

>>> def perimeter(width, height):
        return 2 * width + 2 * height

>>> def minimum_perimeter(area):
        heights = divisors(area)
        perimeters = [perimeter(width(area, h), h) for h in heights]
        return min(perimeters)
```



###### Higher Order functions

```python
>>> def apply_to_all(map_fn, s):
        return [map_fn(x) for x in s]
  
>>> def keep_if(filter_fn, s):
        return [x for x in s if filter_fn(x)]

>>> def reduce(reduce_fn, s, initial):
        reduced = initial
        for x in s:
            reduced = reduce_fn(reduced, x)
        return reduced
```



#### 2.3.4 Sequence Abstraction

###### Membership

`in` or `not in`

```python
>>> digits
[1, 8, 2, 8]
>>> 2 in digits
True
>>> 1828 not in digits
True
```

###### Slicing

> A $slice$ of a sequence is any contiguous span of the original sequence.
>
> Dequence slicing is expressed similarly to element selection, using square brackets. A colon separates the starting and ending indices.
>
>  Any bound that is omitted is assumed to be an extreme value: 0 for the starting index, and the length of the sequence for the ending index.

```python
>>> digits[0:2]
[1, 8]
>>> digits[1:]
[8, 2, 8]
```

###### rich abstraction

* how many behaviors it includes

#### 2.3.5 Strings

> Text values are perhaps more fundamental to computer science than even number.
>
> Constructor: **`str`**
>
> String literals can express arbitrary text, **surrounded by either single or double quotation marks**.

```python
>>> 'I am string!'
'I am string!'
>>> "I've got an apostrophe"
"I've got an apostrophe"

>>> city = 'Berkeley'
>>> len(city)
8
>>> city[3]
'k'
```

* The elements of a string are themselves strings that only a single character.

###### Membership

**`in` operator matches substrings rather than elements.**

```python
>>> 'here' in "Where's Waldo?"
True
```

###### Multiline Literals

Strings aren't limited to a single line.

 Triple quotes delimit string literals that span multiple lines. We have used this triple quoting extensively already for `docstrings`.

`\n` (backslash n) is a single element that represents a new line.

###### String Coercion

A string can be created from any object in Python by calling the `str` constructor function with an object value as its argument. 

This feature of strings is useful for constructing descriptive strings from objects of various types.

```python
>>> str(2) + ' is an element of ' + str(digits)
'2 is an element of [1, 8, 2, 8]'
```



#### 2.3.6 Trees

###### Closure property

> In gereral, a method for combining data values has a closure property if the result of comnbination can iteself be combined using the same method.
>
> Closure is the key to power in any means of combination because it permits us to create **hierachical structures**.

###### Tree

Nesting lists within lists can introduce complexity.

The **tree** is a fundamental data abstraction that imposes regularity on how hierachical values are structured and manipulated.

> A tree has a root **label** and a sequence of **branches**.
>
> Each branch of a tree is a tree.
>
> A tree with no branches is called a **leaf**.

```python
# constructor
def tree(label, branches = []):
    for branch in branches:
        assert is_tree(branch)
    return [label] + list(branches)

# selectors
def label(tree):
    return tree[0]

def branches(tree):
    return tree[1:]

def is_tree(tree):
    if type(tree) != list or len(tree) < 1:
        return False
    for branch in branches(tree):
        if not is_tree(branch):
            return False
    return True

def is_leaf(tree):
    return not branches(tree)
```

###### Fib_tree

Trees can be constructed by nested expressions.

```python
def fib_tree(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return tree(n)
    else:
        left, right = fib_tree(n - 2), fib_tree(n - 1)
        return tree(label(left) + label(right), [left, right])
```



###### Tree processing

```python
def count_leaves(t):
    if is_leaf(t):
        return 1
    else:
        return sum([count_leaves(b) for b in branches(t)])

def leaves(tree):
    """Return a list containing the leaf labels of tree."""

    if is_leaf(tree):
        return [label(tree)]
    else:
        return sum([leaves(b) for b in branches(tree)], [])

def increment(t):
    return tree(label(t) + 1, [increment(b) for b in branches(t)])
  
def print_tree(t, indent = 0):
    print('  ' * indent + str(label(t)))
    for b in branches(t):
        print_tree(b, indent + 1)

def print_sum(t, so_far):
    """Print sum of the path from root to all the leaves"""
    so_far = so_far + label(t)
    if is_leaf(t):
        return so_far
    else:
        for b in branches(t):
            print_sum(b, so_far)

def count_paths(t, total):
    """Return the number of paths from the root to any node in tree t 
    for which the labels along the path sum to tatal"""
    if total - label(t) == 0:
        found = 1
    else:
        found = 0
    return found + sum([count_paths(b, total - label(t))for b in branches(t)])
```
