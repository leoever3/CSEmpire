### 2.5 Object-Oriented Programming



#### 2.5.1 Objects and Classes

* A **class** serves a s a template for all objects whose type is that class.
* Every **object** is an instance of some particular class.
* The act of creating a new object instance is known as ==instantiating== the class.
  * The syntax in Python for instantiating a class is identical to the syntax of calling a function.
* An ==attribute== of an object is a name-value pair associated with the object,  which is accessible via dot notation.
  * In the broader programming community, instance attributes may also be called fields, properties, or instance variables.
* Functions that operate on the object or perform object-specific computations are called ==method==.
  * We say that methods are ==invoked== on a particular object.



#### 2.5.2 Defining classes

```pseudocode
class <name>:
		<suite>
```

Classes are typically organized around manipulating instance attributes, which are the name-valiue pairs associated with each instance of that class.

##### Constructor

The `<suite>` of a `class` statement contains `def` statements that define new methods for objects of that class. 

The method that initializes objects has a special name in Python, \__init__ (two underscores on each side) and is called the ==constructor== for the class.

```python
class Account:
    """An account has balance and a holder"""
    def __init__(self, account_holder):
        self.balance = 0
        self.holder = account_holder
```

==`self`== is bound to the newly created `Account` object.

`balance` and `holder` are **instance attributes**

###### Instantiate

```python
>>> a = Account('Kirk')
>>> a.balance
0
>>> a.holder
'Kirk'
```

The "call" to the `Account` class creates a new object that is an instance of `Account`, then calls the constructor function `__init__`.

##### Identity

Each new account instance has its own balance attribute, the value of which is independent of other objects of the same class.

Object identity is compared using the `is` and `is not` operators. <u>New objects that have user-defined classes are only created when a class is inetantiated with call expression syntax.</u>

```python
>>> a = Account('Kirk')
>>> b = Account('Spock')
>>> a is not b
True

# Binding an object to a new name using assignment does not create a new object.
>>> c = a
>>> c is a
True
```



##### Methods

Object methods are also defined by a `def` statement in the suite of a `class` statement.

```python
class Account:
    """An account has balance and a holder"""
    def __init__(self, account_holder):
        self.balance = 0
        self.holder = account_holder

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance = self.balance + amount
        return amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            return  'Insufficient fund'
        else:
            self.balance = self.balance - amount;
            return self.balance
>>> spock_account = Account('Spock')
>>> spock_account.deposit(100)
100
>>> spock_account.withdraw(90)
10
```

The functino value that is created by a `def` statement within a `class` statement is bound to the declared name.

When a method is invoked via ==dot notation==, the object itself plays a dual role.

1. It determines what the name `withdraw` means; `withdraw` is not a name in the environmentm but instead a name that is local to the `Account` class.
2. It is bound to the first parameter `self` when th `withdraw` method is invoked.



#### 2.5.3 Message Passing and Dot Expression

Fundamental elements of object-oriented programming:

1. Methods, which are defined in class
2. Instance attribute, which are typically assigned in constructors.

The central idea in message passing was that data values should have behavior by responding to messages that are relevant to the abstract type they represent.

##### Dot expressions

```pseudocode
<expression> . <name>
```

The built-in function `getattr` and `hasattr`

```python
>>> getattr(spock_account, 'balance')
10
>>> hasattr(spock_account, 'deposit')
True
```



##### Methods and function

 When a method is invoked on an object, that object is implicitly passed as the first argument to the method. That is, the object that is the value of the `<expression>` to the left of the dot is passed automatically as the first argument to the method named on the right side of the dot expression. As a result, the object is bound to the parameter `self`.

```python
>>> type(Account.deposit)
<class 'function'>
>>> type(spock_account.deposit)
<class 'method'>
```

The first is a standard two-argement function with parameters `self` and  `amount`. The second is a one-argument method, where the name `self` will be bound to the object name `spock_account` automatically when the method is called.

```python
>>> Account.deposit(spock_account, 1001)  # The deposit function takes 2 arguments
1011
>>> spock_account.deposit(1000)           # The deposit method takes 1 argument
2011
```

##### Naming Conventions

> Class names are conventionally written using the CapWords convention (also called CamelCase because the capital letters in the middle of a name look like humps).
>
>  Python's convention dictates that if an attribute name starts with an <u>underscore,</u> it should only be accessed within methods of the class itself, rather than by users of the class.



#### 2.5.4 Class Attributes

Some attribute values are shared across all objects of a given class. Such attributes are associated with the class itself.

Class attributes are created by assignement statements in the suite of a `class` statement outside of any method definition. In the broader developer community, class attributes may also be called calss variables or static variables.

```python
class Account:
    """An account has balance and a holder"""

    interest = 0.02 # A class attribute
    
    def __init__(self, account_holder):
        self.balance = 0
        self.holder = account_holder

>>> spock_account = Account('Spock')
>>> kirk_account = Account('Kirk')
>>> spock_account.interest
0.02
>>> kirk_account.interest
0.02

>>> Account.interest = 0.04
>>> spock_account.interest
0.04
>>> kirk_account.interest
0.04
```



##### Attribute names

```pseudocode
<expression> . <name>
```

To evaluate a dot expression:

1. Evaluate the \<expression> to the left of the dot, which yields the object of the dot expression.
2. \<name> is matched against the **instance attributes** of that object
3. If \<name> does not appear among instance attributes, then \<name> is looked up in the class, which yields a class attribute value.
4. The value is returned unless it is a funciton, in which case a bound method is returned instead.



##### Attribute assignment

All assignment statements that contain a dot expression on their left-hand side affect attributes for the object of that dot expression.

```python
>>> Account.interest = 0.04
>>> kirk_account.interest = 0.08
>>> kirk_account.interest
0.08
>>> spock_account.interest
0.04

>>> Account.interest = 0.05  # changing the class attribute
>>> spock_account.interest     # changes instances without like-named instance attributes
0.05
>>> kirk_account.interest     # but the existing instance attribute is unaffected
0.08
```



#### 2.5.5 Inheritance

When working in the OOP paradigm, we often find that different types are related. That is two classes may have similar attributes, but one represents a **special case** of the other.

A `CheckingAccount` is a specialization of an `Account`. In OOP terminology, the generic account will serve as the base class of `CheckingAccount`, while `CheckingAccount` will be a ==subclass== of `Account`. (The terms *parent class* and *superclass* are also used for the base class, while *child class* is also used for the subclass.)

Inheritance is meant to represent ==is-a== relationships between classes, which contrast with ==has-a== relationships.

* A checking account is a specific type of account.
* A bank has a list of bank accounts that it manages.



#### 2.5.6 Using inheritance

```python
class CheckingAccount(Account):
  	"""A bank account that charges for withdrawals."""
    interest = 0.01
    withdraw_charge = 1
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        return super().withdraw(amount + self.withdraw_fee)
        # return Account.withdraw(self, amount + self.withdraw_fee)
```

1. We introduce a class attribute `withdraw_charge` that is specific to the `CheckingAccount` class.
2. We assign a lower value to the `interest` value
3. We also define a new `withdraw` method to ==override== the behavior defined in the `Account` class.
4. With no further statements in the class suite, all other behavior is **inherited** from the base class `Account`.



To ==look up== a name in class

1. If it names an attribute in the class, return the attribute value
2. Otherwise, look up the name in the base class, if there is one.

```python
>>> checking = CheckingAccount('Sam')
>>> checking.deposit(10)
10
>>> checking.withdraw(5)
4
>>> checking.interest
0.01
```

`deposite()`

1. look fir the name first on the instance
2. then in the `CheckingAccount` class
3. Finally look in `Account` class

The class of an object stays constant throughout. Even though the `deposit` method was found in the `Account` class, `deposit` is called with <u>`self` bound to an instance of `CheckingAccount`, not of `Account`.</u>

##### 

##### Interfaces

An *object interface* is a collection of attributes and conditions on those attributes.

For example, all accounts must have `deposit` and `withdraw` methods that take numerical arguments, as well as a `balance` attribute.



#### 2.5.7 Multiple Inheritance

Python supports the concept of a subclass inheriting attributes from multiple base classes, a language feature called multople inheritance.

![img](http://composingprograms.com/img/multiple_inheritance.png)

```python
>>> class SavingsAccount(Account):
        deposit_charge = 2
        def deposit(self, amount):
            return Account.deposit(self, amount - self.deposit_charge)
        
>>> class AsSeenOnTVAccount(CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount):
        def __init__(self, account_holder):
            self.holder = account_holder
            self.balance = 1           # A free dollar!
```

##### Amibiguous reference

Python resolves name left ro right then upwards:

* AsSeenOnTVAccount --> CheckingAccount --> SavingsAccount --> Account --> object



#### 2.5.8 The Role of objects

The python object system is designed to make **data abstraction** and **message passing** both convenient and flexible.

The specialized syntax of classes, methods, inheritance, and dot expressions all enable us to formalize the object metaphor in our programs, which improves our ability to organize large programs.

In particular, we would like our object system to promote a ***separation of concerns*** among the different aspects of the program. Abstraction barriers enforce the boundaries between different aspects of a large program.

One should not feel compelled to fit every bit of logic in a program within a class, especially when defining independent functions for manipulating data is more natural. Functions can also enforce a separation of concerns.

Learning to identify when to introduce a new class, as opposed to a **new function,** in order to simplify or modularize a program, is an important design skill in software engineering that deserves careful attention.
