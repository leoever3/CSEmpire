### 2.1 Introduction

$Chapter\ 1$ concentrates on **computational processes** and  the role of **functions** in program design.

* How to use primitive data and primitive operations
* How to form compuond functions through composition and control
* How to create functional abstractions by giving names to process
* High-order functions enhave the power of our languge by enable us to manipulate general methods of computation



$Chapter\ 2$ focuses on data.

* Allow us to represent and manipulate information about many different domains
* Effective use of built-in and user-defined data types are fundamental to data processing applications.



#### 2.1.1 Native Data Types

> Every value on Python has a $class$ that determines what type of value it is.
>
> Values that share a class also share behavior.

```python
>>> type(2)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(1.5)
<class 'float'>
>>> type(1+1j)
<class 'complex'>
```

> Native data types are built into the Python language.
>
> Properties of native data types:
>
> 1. There are expressions that evaluate to values of native types, called **literals**
>    * Integer literals: sequences of adjacent numerals evaluate to `int` values
> 2. There are built-in functions and operators to manipulate values of native types



Python includes $3$ native <u>numeric types</u>

1. integers(int)
2. real numbers(float)
3. complex number(complex)

###### Floats

* "a floating point" representation
* `float` values should be treated as **approximations** to real values.

```python
>>> 1 / 3 * 7 * 3
6.999999999999999

>>> 1/3 == 0.333333333333333312345  # Beware of float approximation
True
```



###### Non-numeric types

* bool
* str
