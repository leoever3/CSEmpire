### 2.8 Efficiency

Decisions of how to represent and process data are often influenced by the efficiency of alternatives.

Efficiency refers to the computational resources used by a representation or process, such as time and memory.



#### 2.8.1 Measuring Efficiency

##### Time

A reliable way to characterize the efficiency of a program is to measure how many times some event occurs, such as a function call.

```python
>>> def fib(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
        
>>> def count(f):
        def counted(*args):
            counted.call_count += 1
            return f(*args)
        counted.call_count = 0
        return counted

>>> fib = count(fib)
>>> fib(19)
4181
>>> fib.call_count
13529
```

##### Space

In evaluating an expression, the interpreter preserves all *active* environments and all values and frames referenced by those environments.

*  An environment is active if it provides the evaluation context for some expression being evaluated. 
* An environment becomes inactive whenever the function call for which its first frame was created finally returns.

```python
>>> def count_frames(f):
        def counted(*args):
            counted.open_count += 1
            counted.max_count = max(counted.max_count, counted.open_count)
            result = f(*args)
            counted.open_count -= 1
            return result
        counted.open_count = 0
        counted.max_count = 0
        return counted
>>> fib = count_frames(fib)
>>> fib(19)
4181
>>> fib.open_count
0
>>> fib.max_count
19
>>> fib(24)
46368
>>> fib.max_count
24
```



#### 2.8.2 Memoization

Tree-recursive computational process can often be made more efficient through ==memoization==, a powerful technique for increasing the efficiency of recursive functions that repeat computation.

Memoization can be expressed naturally as a higher-order function, which can also be used as a decorator.

```python
>>> def memo(f):
        cache = {}
        def memoized(n):
            if n not in cache:
                cache[n] = f(n)
            return cache[n]
        return memoized
```

#### 2.8.3 Orders of Growth

Processes can differ massively in the rates at which they consume the computational resources of space and time, as the previous examples illustrate. 

A useful way to analyze a process is to categorize it along with a group of processes that all have similar requirements. 

A useful categorization is the ==order of growth== of a process, which expresses in simple terms how the resource requirements of a process grow as a function of the input.

##### Theta Notation

> $n$: a parameter that measures the size of the input
>
> $R(n)$: the amount of some resource that the process requires for an input of size $n$.
>
> We say that $R(n)$ has order of growth $Θ(f(n))$, written $R(n)=Θ(f(n))$ (pronounced "theta of $f(n)$"), if there are positive constants $k1$ and $k2$ independent of $n$ such that
> $$
> k1⋅f(n)≤R(n)≤k2⋅f(n)
> $$
> for any value of $n$ larger than some minimum $m$. In other words, for large nn, the value $R(n)$ is always sandwiched between two values that both scale with $f(n)$:
>
> - A lower bound $k1⋅f(n)$ and
> - An upper bound $k2⋅f(n)$



#### 2.8.4 Example: Exponentiation

###### linear

```python
>>> def exp(b, n):
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        return b * exp(b, n-1)
```

###### logarithm

```python
>>> def square(x):
        return x*x
>>> def fast_exp(b, n):
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return square(fast_exp(b, n//2))
        else:
            return b * fast_exp(b, n-1)
```

The difference between Θ(logn)Θ(log⁡n) growth and Θ(n)Θ(n) growth becomes striking as nn becomes large.



#### 2.8.5 Growth Categories

#####  Lower-order terms

As the input to a process grows, the fastest growing part of a computation dominates the total resources used.

##### Common categories

| **Category** | **Theta Notation** | **Growth Description**                  | **Example**     |
| :----------- | :----------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
| Constant     | $Θ(1)$             | Growth is independent of the input      | `abs`           |
| Logarithmic  | $Θ(log⁡\ n)$        | Multiplying input increments resources  | `binary search` |
| Linear       | $Θ(n)$             | Incrementing input increments resources | `loop`          |
| Quadratic    | $Θ(n^2)$           | Incrementing input adds n resources     | `nest loop`     |
| Exponential  | $Θ(b^n)$           | Incrementing input multiplies resources | `fib`           |
