#### 4.3 Declarative Programming

Data values are often stored in large repositories called **databases**. A database consists of a data store containing the data values along with an interface for retrieving and transforming those values.

Each value stored in a database is called a **record**. Records with similar structure are grouped into **tables**.

Records are retrieved and transformed using **queries**, which are statement in query language. By far, the most ubiquitous query language in use today is called ==Structured Query Language== or ==SQL==. 

SQL is an example of a **declarative programming language**. Statements do not describe computations directly, but instead describe the desired result of some computation. It is the role of the *query interpreter* of the database system to design and perform a computational process to produce such a result.

#### 4.3.1 Tables

A table, also called a **relation**, has a fixed number of named and typed columns.

Each row of a table represents a data record and has one value for each column.

| **Latitude** | **Longitude** | **Name**    |
| :----------- | :------------ | :---------- |
| 38           | 122           | Berkeley    |
| 42           | 71            | Cambridge   |
| 45           | 93            | Minneapolis |

A table with a single row can be created in the SQL language using a `select` statement, in which the row values are seperated by commas and the column names follow the key words `as`. 

**All SQL statements end in a semicolon**.

```sql
sqlite> SELECT 38 AS latitude, 122 AS longitude, "Berkeley" AS name;
38|122|Berkeley
```

A multi-line table can be constructed by `union`, which combines the rows of the tables.

```sql
sqlite> SELECT 38 AS latitude, 122 AS longitude, "Berkeley" AS name UNION
   ...> SELECT 42,             71,               "Cambridge"        UNION
   ...> SELECT 45,             93,               "Minneapolis";
38|122|Berkeley
42|71|Cambridge
45|93|Minneapolis
```

A table can be given a name using a `create table` statement.

```sql
sqlite> create table cities as
   ...>    select 38 as latitude, 122 as longitude, "Berkeley" as name union
   ...>    select 42,             71,               "Cambridge"        union
   ...>    select 45,             93,               "Minneapolis";
```

Once a table is named, that name can be used in a `from` clause within a `select` statement. All columns of a table can be displayed using the special `select *` form.

```sql
sqlite> select * from cities;
38|122|Berkeley
42|71|Cambridge
45|93|Minneapolis
```



#### 4.3.2 Select Statements

A `select` statement defines a new table either by listing the values in a single row or, more commonly, by projecting an existing table using a from clause.

```pseudocode
SELECT [column decription] from [existing table name]
```

The columns of the resulting table are described by a **comma-separated** list of expressions that are each evaluated for each row of the existing input table.

```sql
sqlite> select name, 60*abs(latitude-38) from cities;
Berkeley|0
Cambridge|240
Minneapolis|420
```

Column descriptions include:

* infix operators such as + and %
* Built-in funcitons such as `abs` and `round` and parentheses that describe evaluation order.

Optionally, each expression can be followed by the keyword `as` and a column name. When the entire table is given a name, it is often helpful to give each column a name so that it can be referenced in future `select` statements.

```sql
sqlite> create table distances as
   ...>   select name, 60*abs(latitude-38) as distance from cities;
sqlite> select distance/5, name from distances;
0|Berkeley
48|Cambridge
84|Minneapolis
```

##### Where clauses

A `select` statement can also include a `where` clause with a **filtering** expression. This expression filters the rows that are projected. Only a row for which the filtering expression evaluates to a true value will be used to prodeuce a rowin the resulting table.

```sql
sqlite> create table cold as
   ...>   select name from cities where latitude > 43;
sqlite> select name, "is cold!" from cold;
Minneapolis|is cold!
```

##### Order clauses

A `select` statement can also express an ordering over the resulting table. An `order` clause contains an ordering expression that is evaluated for each unfiltered row. The resulting values of this expression are used as a sorting criterion for the result table.

```sql
sqlite> select distance, name from distances order by -distance;
84|Minneapolis
48|Cambridge
0|Berkeley
```



#### 4.3.3 Joins

Databases typically contain multiple tables, and queries can require information contained within different tables to compute a desired result.

```sql
sqlite> create table temps as
   ...>   select "Berkeley" as city, 68 as temp union
   ...>   select "Chicago"         , 59         union
   ...>   select "Minneapolis"     , 55;
```

Data are combined by ==joining== multiple tables together into one, a fundamental operation in database system.

There are many methods of joining.

When tables are joined, the resulting table contains a new row for each combination of rows in the input tables. If two tables are joined and the left table has $m$ rows and the right table has $n$ rows, then the joined table will have $m*n$ rows.

Joins are expressed in SQL by separating table names by commas in the `from` clause of a `select` statement.

```sql
sqlite> select * from cities, temps;
38|122|Berkeley|Berkeley|68
38|122|Berkeley|Chicago|59
38|122|Berkeley|Minneapolis|55
42|71|Cambridge|Berkeley|68
42|71|Cambridge|Chicago|59
42|71|Cambridge|Minneapolis|55
45|93|Minneapolis|Berkeley|68
45|93|Minneapolis|Chicago|59
45|93|Minneapolis|Minneapolis|55
```

Joins are typically accompanied by a `where` clause that expresses a relationship between the two tables. In SQL, numeric equlity is tested with a single $=$ symbol.

```SQL
sqlite> select name, latitude, temp from cities, temps where name = city;
Berkeley|38|68
Minneapolis|45|55
```

##### Aliases and dot expression

Tables may have overlapping column names, and a table may also be joined with itself. We need a method for disambiguating tables. To do so, SQL allows us to give **aliases** to tables within a from caluse using the keyword `as` and to refer to a column within a particular table using  a **dot expression**.

```sql
sqlite> select a.city, b.city, a.temp - b.temp
   ...>        from temps as a, temps as b where a.city < b.city;
Berkeley|Chicago|10
Berkeley|Minneapolis|15
Chicago|Minneapolis|5
```

The alphabetical ordering constraint in the `where` clause ensures that each pair will only appear once in the result.



#### 4.3.4 Interpreting SQL

#### 4.3.5 Recursive Select Statements

#### 4.3.6 Aggregation and Grouping

The `select` statement can perform aggregation operations over multiple rows.

* `max`
* `min`
* `count`
* `sum`

```sql
sqlite> create table animals as
  ....>   select "dog" as name, 4 as legs, 20 as weight union
  ....>   select "cat"        , 4        , 10           union
  ....>   select "ferret"     , 4        , 10           union
  ....>   select "t-rex"      , 2        , 12000        union
  ....>   select "penguin"    , 2        , 10           union
  ....>   select "bird"       , 2        , 6;
sqlite> select max(legs) from animals;
4
sqlite> select sum(weight) from animals;
12056
sqlite> select min(legs), max(weight) from animals where name <> "t-rex";
2|20
```

The `distinct` keyword ensures that no repeated values in a column are included in the aggregation.

```sql
sqlite> select count(legs) from animals;
6
sqlite> select count(*) from animals;
6
sqlite> select count(distinct legs) from animals;
2
```

The `group by` and `having` clauses of a `select` statement are used to partition rows into groups and select only a subset of the groups. Any aggregate functions in the `having` clause or column description will apply to each group independently, rather than the entire set of rows in the table.

```sql
sqlite> select legs, max(weight) from animals group by legs;
2|12000
4|20
sqlite> select weight from animals group by weight having count(*)>1;
10
```

Muiltiple columns and full expressions can appear in the `group by` clause, and groups will be formed for every unique combination of values that result. Typically, the expression used for grouping also appeears in the column description so that it is easy to identify which result row resulted from each group.

```sql
sqlite> select max(name), legs, weight from animals group by legs, weight
  ....>   having max(weight) < 100;
bird|2|6
penguin|2|10
ferret|4|10
dog|4|20
```

A `having` clause can contain the same filtering as a `where` clause, but can also include calls to aggregate functions. For the fastest execution and clearest use of the language, <u>a condition that filters individual rows based on their contents should appear in a `where` clause, while a `having` clause should be used only when aggregation is required in the condition</u> (such as specifying a minimum `count` for a group).

When using a `group by ` clause, column descriptions can contain expressions that do not aggregate. Whenever the row that corresponds to aggreagtion is unclear, the value cosen may be arbitrary.
