### Package

**Package** — a namespace that organizes classes and interfaces. In general, when creating packages you should follow the following naming convention: package name starts with the website address, backwards.

**Creating a Package, in IntelliJ**

1.) File → New Package

1.) Choose package name (i.e. “ug.joshh.animal”)

**Adding (old) Java Files to a Package, in IntelliJ**

1.) Add “package [packagename]” to the top of the file.

2.) Move the .java file into the corresponding folder.

### Default packages

You should avoid leaving your files in the default package (unless it’s a very small example program). This is because code from the default package cannot be imported, and it is possible to accidentally create classes with the same name under the default package.

### JAR Files

To create a JAR file: 

1. Go to File → Project Structure → Artifacts → JAR → From modules with dependencies

2.  Click OK a couple of times.

3. Click Build -> Build Artifacts.

The jar file will be generated in a folder called “Artifacts”.

#### Build Systems

Popular build systems include:Ant Maven Gradle (ascendant)



### Access control

Package members considered more “**secret**” than subclass

* Extending classes you didn’t write is common.

* Packages are typically modified only by a specific team of humans.

**Access Is Based Only on Static Types**
