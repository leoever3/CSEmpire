#### Generic DLLists



```java
public class DLList<BleepBlorp> {
    private IntNode sentinel;
    private int size;

    public class IntNode {
        public IntNode prev;
        public BleepBlorp item;
        public IntNode next;
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

```java
DLList<String> d2 = new DLList<>("hello");
d2.addLast("world");
```

- In the .java file **implementing** a data structure, specify your generic type name only **once** at the very top of the file after the class name.
- In other .java files, which use your data structure, specify the specific desired type during declaration, and use the **empty** diamond operator during instantiation.
- If you need to instantiate a generic over a primitive type, use `Integer`, `Double`, `Character`, `Boolean`, `Long`, `Short`, `Byte`, or `Float` instead of their primitive equivalents.





### Array

#### Basic

**Arrays** are a special kind of object which consists of a **numbered** sequence of memory boxes.

* To get ith item of array A, use A[i].
* Unlike **class** instances which have have **named** memory boxes.

Arrays consist of:

* A fixed integer **length** (cannot change!)A sequence of N memory boxes where **N=length**, such that:
  * All of the boxes hold the same type of value (and have same # of bits).
  * The boxes are numbered 0 through length-1.

Like instances of classes:

* You get one reference when its created.
* If you reassign all variables containing that reference, you can never get the array back.

Unlike classes, arrays do not have methods.

#### Initiation

Three valid notations:

x = **new** **int**[3];

y = **new** **int**[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

**int**[] z = {9, 10, 11, 12, 13};

#### Arraycopy

Two ways to copy arrays:

* Item by item using a loop.

* Using arraycopy. Takes 5 parameters:
  * Source array
  * Start position in source
  * Target array
  * Start position in target
  * Number to copy 

**<u>System.arraycopy(b, 0, x, 3, 2);</u>**

#### **2D Arrays**

#### **Arrays vs. Classes**

Arrays and Classes can both be used to organize a bunch of memory boxes.

* Array boxes are accessed using [] notation.
* Class boxes are accessed using dot notation.
* Array boxes must all be of the same type.
* Class boxes may be of different types.
* Both have a fixed number of boxes.
* Array indices can be computed at runtime.
* Class member variable names CANNOT be computed and used at runtime.

The Java compiler does not treat text on either side of a dot as an expression, and thus it is not evaluated.
